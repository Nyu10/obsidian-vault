De Tocqueville says it comes from taking some “incomplete joy of this world” and building your entire life on it. That is the definition of idolatry.

We may not actually burn incense to Artemis, but when money and career are raised to cosmic proportions, we perform a kind of child sacrifice, neglecting family and community to achieve a higher place in business and gain more wealth and prestige.

God was saying that the human heart takes good things like a successful career, love, material possessions, even family, and turns them into ultimate things. Our hearts deify them as the center of our lives, because, we think, they can give us significance and security, safety and fulfillment, if we attain them.

The greater the good, the more likely we are to expect that it can satisfy our deepest needs and hopes. Anything can serve as a counterfeit god, especially the very best things in life.

What is an idol? It is anything more important to you than God, anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God, anything you seek to give you what only God can give.

A counterfeit god is anything so central and essential to your life that, should you lose it, your life would feel hardly worth living.

An idol has such a controlling position in your heart that you can spend most of your passion and energy, your emotional and financial resources, on it without a second thought. It can be family and children, or career and making money, or achievement and critical acclaim, or saving “face” and social standing. It can be a romantic relationship, peer approval, competence and skill, secure and comfortable circumstances, your beauty or your brains, a great political or social cause, your morality and virtue, or even success in the Christian ministry. When your meaning in life is to fix someone else’s life, we may call it “co-dependency” but it is really idolatry. An idol is whatever you look at and say, in your heart of hearts, “If I have that, then I’ll feel my life has meaning, then I’ll know I have value, then I’ll feel significant and secure.” There are many ways to describe that kind of relationship to something, but perhaps the best one is worship.

There are cultural idols, such as military power, technological progress, and economic prosperity. The idols of traditional societies include family, hard work, duty, and moral virtue, while those of Western cultures are individual freedom, self-discovery, personal affluence, and fulfillment. All these good things can and do take on disproportionate size and power within a society. They promise us safety, peace, and happiness if only we base our lives on them.

What do we enjoy imagining? What are our fondest dreams?
We look to our idols to love us, to provide us with value and a sense of
beauty, significance, and worth.
	startup life probably making more money
		i shouldn't make more money for a mom who wasted 1 million dollars lol 


What do we fear the most? What, if we lost it, would make life not worth
living? We make “sacrifices” to appease and please our gods, who we
believe will protect us. We look to our idols to provide us with a sense of
confidence and safety.


In this paradigm, we can locate idols by looking at our most unyielding emotions. What makes us uncontrollably
angry, anxious, or despondent? What racks us with a guilt we can’t shake?
Idols control us, since we feel we must have them or life is meaningless.

money, feelign loved


There’s a good chance her drive to give her children wonderful lives will actually be the thing that ruins them


Saint Paul wrote that one of the worst things God can do to

someone is to “give them over to the desires of their hearts” (Romans 1:24).


God called

Abraham to leave all that was familiar—his friends, most of his family, and

everything that he believed meant safety, prosperity, and peace—and go out

into the wilderness, uncertain of his destination. He was asked to give up,

for God’s sake, nearly all the worldly hopes and things that a human heart

desires.

And he did. He was called to “go” and he went, “though he did not know

where he was going” (Hebrews 11:8)
