#### Chapter 3
There is theology implied, but it is always “task theology” — theology being written for or brought to bear on the task at hand

First, you need to consult your Bible dictionary or the introduction to your commentary to find out as much as possible about Corinth and its people. Among other important things, you should note that by ancient standards it was a relatively young city — only ninety-four years old when Paul first visited it. Yet because of its strategic location for commerce, it was cosmopolitan, wealthy, a patron of the arts, religious (at least twenty-six temples and shrines), and well-known for its sensuality. With a little reading and imagination one can see that it was a bit of New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, all wrapped up in one place. Therefore, it will hardly be a letter to the community church in Rural Corners, USA. All of this will need to be kept in mind as you read in order to note how it will affect your understanding on nearly every page. 


Second, and now especially for study purposes, you need to develop the habit of reading the whole letter through in one sitting, and preferably aloud, so that mouth and ear join the eye. You may well be surprised by how much more you retain when you learn to read this way. You will need to block out an hour or more to do this, but nothing can ever substitute for reading the whole letter through at one time.


1. what you notice about the recipients themselves (e.g., whether Jew or Greek, whether wealthy or slave; their problems, attitudes, etc.) 2. Paul’s attitudes 3. any specific things mentioned as to the specific occasion of the letter 4. the letter’s natural, logical divisions


(1) Read 1 Corinthians 1 – 4 through at least two times (preferably in two different translations). Again, you are reading to get the big picture, to get a “feel” for the whole argument. After you have read it through the second time (or even the third or fourth if you want to read it in each of your translations), go back and (2) list in a notebook everything you can find that tells you something about the recipients and their problem. Try to be thorough here and list everything, even if after a closer look you want to go back and scratch off some items as not entirely relevant. (3) Then make another list of key words and repeated phrases that indicate the subject matter of Paul’s answer.


THINK PARAGRAPHS
	lol

Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person..."
	this refers to the church
The final point is that the **local church** is sacred. It is the place where the Spirit lives on earth.
- **The Sin:** Creating divisions and factions.
- **The Consequence:** If you "destroy" the church with your ego or your politics, God will "destroy" you because you are messing with His Temple.
I shoudln't be upset at dennis for failling



Phillipians 1 practice
Read Philippians 1:12 – 2:18 several times. Note that Paul’s argument to this point has gone something like this: The occasion is that Paul is in prison (1:13, 17) and the Philippian church has sent him a gift through a member named Epaphroditus (see 2:25, 30; 4:14 – 18). Apparently Epaphroditus contracted an illness that ordinarily ended in death, and the church had heard of it and was saddened (2:26). But God spared him, so now Paul is sending him back (2:25 – 30) with this letter in order to (1) tell them how things are with him (1:12 – 26), (2) thank them for their gift (4:10, 14 – 19), and (3) exhort them on a couple of matters: to live in harmony (1:27 – 2:18; 4:2 – 3) and to avoid the Judaizing heresy


**The Verses:** _"Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel... standing firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you."_

- **The Point:** Paul is telling them to "hold the line."
    
- **The Context:** The church in Philippi is being bullied by their neighbors (opposition). Paul’s argument is: "If you guys are busy fighting each other, the people opposing you have already won." Unity is their best defense.

I didn't realize this 

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit
how do i nto be selifhs

- **The Author's Insight:** People often use these verses just to prove Jesus is God. But the author says Paul’s _real_ intent is to say: **"If God was willing to give up His status and die for you, surely you can stop arguing over who is most important in the church."**
    
- **The Progression:** 1. Jesus had the highest status (God). 2. He "emptied" himself (became a human/servant). 3. He went to the lowest point (the Cross). 4. **Therefore**, God exalted him to the highest place.


In many cases the reason the problem passages are so difficult for us is that, frankly, they were not written to us.

What can be said for certain? Some of the Corinthians really were being “baptized for the dead,” whether we like to admit it or not.

But we do not know and probably never will know who was doing it, for whom they were doing it, and why they were doing it. The details and the meaning of the practice, therefore, are probably forever lost to us.


### Chapter 4 Hermeuntics 

a text cannot mean what it never could have meant to its author or readers.

Whenever we share comparable particulars (i.e., similar specific life situations) with the first-century hearers, God’s word to us is the same as his word to them


### 1. The "Red Line": Temple Feasts (8:10; 10:14–22)

**The Conflict:** Some "smart" Christians in Corinth were saying, _"Hey, we know these idols aren't real, so why can't we go to the temple parties with our neighbors?"_

Same with Frat parties lol 


On what freedoms
1. What the Epistles specifically indicate as matters of indifference may still be regarded as such: food, drink, observance of days, etc. 


2. Matters of indifference are not inherently moral but are cultural — even if they stem from religious culture. Matters that tend to differ from culture to culture, therefore, even among genuine believers, may usually be considered to be matters of indifference (e.g., wine and nonwine cultures).


3. It is especially important to note that the sin-lists in the Epistles (e.g., Rom 1:29 – 30; 1 Cor 5:11; 6:9 – 10; 2 Tim 3:2 – 4) never include the first-century equivalents of the items we have listed above. Moreover, such matters of indifference are never included among the various lists of Christian imperatives (e.g., Rom 12; Eph 5; Col 3; etc.). We know that not all will agree with our assessment. However, according to Romans 14, people on both sides of any of these matters are neither to judge nor disparage one another. The free person is not to flaunt their freedom; the person for whom such matters are a deep personal conviction is not to condemn someone else


> **The Logic:** If the world was split 50/50 on a topic and the Bible picked one side, that’s likely a **permanent command**. If the whole world only had _one way_ of doing things (like slavery) and the Bible just went along with it while trying to make it more "Christian," that’s likely **culturally relative**.


**The Logic:** Paul already told women _how_ to pray and prophesy in Chapter 11. Why would he suddenly tell them to be "silent" three chapters later? Fee thinks it's a later addition by someone more sexist than Paul.

- **The Question:** How can verse 9 be "cultural" (temporary) but verse 12 be "divine" (permanent) when they are in the same paragraph?

### Chapter 5 Narratives

The account of Moses going up and down Mount Sinai in Exodus 19 – 34 is not an allegory of the descent and ascent of the soul to God. Elijah’s battle with the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18) is not an allegory of Jesus’ triumph over evil spirits in the New Testament. The story of Abraham’s securing a bride for Isaac (Gen 24) is not an allegory about Christ (Isaac) securing a bride (the church/Rebekah) through the Holy Spirit (the servant).


Old testamnet narratives are not allegories

For example, in the narrative of David’s adultery with Bathsheba (2 Sam 11), you will not find any such statement as, “In committing adultery David did wrong.” You are expected to know that adultery is wrong because this is taught explicitly already in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:14), which David would have known very well. The narrative illustrates the harmful consequences of his adultery to the personal life of King David and to his ability to rule.
