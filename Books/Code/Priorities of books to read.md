| **1**        | **System Design Interview (Alex Xu)**            | **Practicality First.** This gives you immediate wins. It provides the "visual patterns" and high-level components (Load Balancers, Key-Value stores) you need to talk the talk.                                                    |
| **2**        | **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** | **The Reality Check.** Alex Xu tells you to "use a cache." This book tells you _why_ a cache works at the hardware level. It prevents you from being a "surface-level" engineer who just memorizes diagrams.                        |
| **3**        | **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**         | **The Concurrency Masterclass.** System design is all about handling multiple users at once. This book teaches you the deep mechanics of threads and locks that make Alex Xu’s "distributed locks" make sense.                      |
| **4**        | **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**        | **The Professional Standard.** Once you've finished Alex Xu, you'll realize his book is a bit "simplified." This book is the "Level 2" version that explains the hard trade-offs (like why data replication is actually difficult). |
| **5**        | **Understanding Distributed Systems**            | **The Modern Wrapper.** This acts as the final glue, covering modern topics like Observability, Security, and Microservice patterns that round out your knowledge.                                                                  |
