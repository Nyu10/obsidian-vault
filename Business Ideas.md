teaching kids how to vibe code or anyone

- **Twitter/X (#BuildInPublic):** This is where most high-earning solo founders live. Use the hashtag #buildinpublic to share your progress, wins, and even your failures. People will start to follow your journey and offer advice.
    
- **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com):** When you are ready to show what you’ve built, this is where you launch. Engaging with other people's launches here is the best way to make friends with other builders.




- **The 80/20 Rule:** 20% of your time should be spent coding; 80% should be spent on distribution (Twitter, LinkedIn, SEO, Cold Outreach).
    
- **Kill the Tech Debt Obsession:** Forget Kubernetes, Microservices, and 100% test coverage. Professional solos use "Boring Tech" (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe) to ship in days, not months. If it breaks because you have too many users, _that_ is a high-quality problem you can solve later.
