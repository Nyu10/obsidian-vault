**Description:** Non-request prompts. The user embeds the request within a natural, "rambling" sentence, often providing context or personal statements first. i.e., the user just talking to the LLM about something.

**Example:** "You know, I'm feeling really hungry. I saw a commercial for an Italian restaurant, and it looked so good. I already have pasta, but don’t have any ready-made sauce, so I would need to start with tomato paste. What are some easy ideas?"
