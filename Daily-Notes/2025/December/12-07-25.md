## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes


Lowkey so sad about mom's finanical situation
	it's actually so bad, yet all my needs are provided, and yet i somehow am max contributing to my retirement, i could have contributed an extra 22k to her debt 
	ima start next year after i pay off my own debt tbh 


wow the treasures of this world should not satisfy
	why am i being of this world, idolizing money and security and stability 

i should be aiming to grind for his kingdom and being a kimgodm builder and owekr
