## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

DIdn't do devos last 2 days was pretty bad 
feel kind of bad because kayla doesn't even call it out because if i planed thsi trip and legitimately cared then it would've been in the itinerary


#### On reformed thelogy
For Reformed Christians, theology isn't just about individual interpretation; it's summarized and formalized in communal documents that define their faith. These historic standards are often more important than the individual writings of Calvin himself.

### 2. Spiritual Foundation

- **Growing Curiosity:** Do you have an **insatiable hunger** for God's Word? Do you find yourself reading Scripture and wishing you knew Greek/Hebrew to go deeper?
    
- **Discipline:** Have you developed consistent habits of prayer, Scripture reading, and worship _before_ seminary? Seminary will test your faith, and you need established disciplines to rely on when the workload gets heavy.

i am secure in my faith, but i know i am flawed in sexual sin and idolatry

- **Clarity on the _Why_:** Why are you going? Your current goal is solid ("knowledge, legitimacy, intellectual writing"). If your _only_ goal was just intellectual knowledge, an M.A. would suffice. If your M.Div. is about **equipping you for maximum kingdom impact** (which includes a possible pastoral role), you're on the right track.

- **Confirmation from Others:** **This is critical.** Has your pastor, elders, mentors, or small group leaders affirmed your spiritual gifts for teaching, leadership, and shepherding? God rarely calls people in isolation; your calling should be confirmed by the community that knows you best.

		- no one else really 

i really need to mark all my meetups
and this semeseter break down 

and then add matthew 
and have accountabiltiy with pattrick and justin

not only save souls 


| **If you Skip Seminary**                                                                                                                                                 | **If you Attend Seminary (M.Div.)**                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Pros:** Maximum immediate time for evangelism and ministry. Zero debt.                                                                                                 | **Pros:** Equips you to **teach and train others** who will disciple hundreds more (the multiplier effect). Provides the skills to sustain a **lifelong ministry** through burnout and theological challenges. |
| **Cons:** Risk of "spiritual burnout." Lack of tools to correctly interpret Scripture (2 Timothy 2:15). Inability to lead a movement deeper than you've personally gone. | **Cons:** Sacrifices 6-10 years of immediate, full-time ministry. Requires $40,000+ investment and intense time management.                                                                                    |


**Seminary Discipleship:** Seminary equips you to take a disciple **far deeper** than surface-level devotion. You can teach a small group _how to read the Old Testament Prophets_, _how to defend the resurrection_, or _how to think through Christian ethics_—material that makes you a valuable, sought-after resource. The goal is to move from being a disciple-maker to a **leader-maker**—training others to lead and teach.


ask karina about her time in bible college and why she stopped


for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable
just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, so they too now have become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you

For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all 


mom said she wanted to go to seminary when i said i wanted to which really pissed me off because seh wanted to make it about herslef
she's so selfish and broken yet i am also so broken for calling her out

Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice


idk what hpapened this trip but i feel a really strong callign to go to seminary
even if my academic reccomendation won't be great 
thinking of pjosh, karina, and phil 340 professor

idk how it happened??? i had a thought before pjosh meeting about seminary idk what led to it, i don't even rememebr thet hought why did i think of it before my pjosh talk? 

i guess i was always mentiong to kayla i wanted to do seminary as soon as this summer because what else would i be spending my time for 
and then i argued with my mom and realized i'm not gonna live with her as long as joseph is there
and idk i guess given my unique circumstances somehow, i'm in the privelege to be able to apply to a school liek duke and shoot my shot 



my statement of purpose -> 

testimony of why i believe 
what i'm currently doing in ministry on campus 
how I felt called to seminary -> i mean somehow i think logisticalyl makes sense, but at its core I want ot worship God with my brain and 


Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice

renewing of the mind 


the intentional ways God has lead me to umich campus 
and transformed my whole life not only thorugh a boston sermon
but through that weird beach experience where they were doing devos 
and people never knew how weak my fatih was and even that college group -> asking about predestination lol 
idk how that time transformed me but it was odd but greatly revived me
especially that time i told kristina after bowling that i believed it was true, and justin started going to AIV because he believed 


my FIRE should not be retiring to travel the world in bali
but rather a life long pursuit of obedience to God his calling for me, and my focus on discipleship, evangelism
and my ability for kingdom impact


wow hudson taylor's story is literalyl crazy depending on money to pay his rent. When have I trusted God like that
I guess for leading me still in ann arbor and half the year is over
