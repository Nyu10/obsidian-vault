## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

- - "If God was once a man, does that mean He has a God above Him?"
        
    - "When you say 'saved by grace,' what exactly does 'saved' mean in your theology?"


Oh Lord, I'm really disappointed in myself for wasitng 1 hour rotting
its kind of sad
like short term it was somewhat enjoyable

long term i'm in pain

	this is good, seminary artifically uplifts my knowledge just so i can be perceived a certain way when I realyl should be saturated by the word 


When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, He responded to every temptation from Satan by quoting Scripture from memory (Matthew 4:1-11). It is your defense against lies and temptation. As Psalm 119:11 says, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."

16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.

proverbs 31 wife lol
 wife of noble character who can find?  
     She is worth far more than rubies.

She gets up while it is still night;  
     she provides food for her family  
     and portions for her female servants.



3 Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. 2 Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach


above reproach -> no criticism can be made
temperate and self contorlled -> I get angry at times for sure


, 3 not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.

defintely quarrlesome with kayla
defintely a lover of money sometimes -> gambling away real money the app has given me so bad 

4 He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. 

i'm gonna have respectful children

5 (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) 

my dad did not manage his own family 

6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. 

rip the story of brian price feel bad 


7 He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.

A fall from grace, particularly a public one, is a strategic victory for Satan. The devil can use the resulting shame, discouragement, and loss of credibility to completely undermine the leader's ministry and potentially lead them into further sin (such as despair, pride, or bitterness).
	this is so sad
	but i guess god can protect me if it ever happens?

"I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more" (Hebrews 8:12).



If anyone are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 9 They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.

deacons to pastor role 

11 In the same way,the women  are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.

12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. 13 Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
