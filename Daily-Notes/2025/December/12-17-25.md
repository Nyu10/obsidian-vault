## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


flight is 50 minutes late kind of annoying 
there's no wifi 
we're not evne in the air yet but i'ma do devos 

Romans 12:1-3
 Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. 2 Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

-> Do not conform to the pattenr of this world
I think I've always struggled with desiring a higher payiing career, especially since I have the option to leave Ann Arboer every year. Have a lot of talented peers that are making a lot more than me at Robinhood + other startups, makes me really think "what if" I didn't stay, especially since ministry here has been difficult. 

This famous passage always speaks to me because I probably constantly do forget that my inheritance is not in this world, but my eternal treasure is in God himself and either way comparison and the accumulation of wealth is not the point of life. I pray that I can align my life with Gods will and to be a living sacrifice, not coveting but transformign my mind daily to be like Christ. 


Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.

i should not think of myself so highly 
i am a small ant in the grand scheme of life 
i need to be a wariror for God's kingdom instead of rotting and constantly seeking the treasure of this world 


so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us
	we all have different gifts 

 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.

	Seminary and that startup linkedin is so different lol 

Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality


the individual’s responsibility for worship and personal transformation (vv. [1–2](https://ref.ly/Ro12.1-2)),



The three paths
1) stayed on this one 
	1) 5 years ann arbor probably like dennis leading missions 
		1) probs be pretty good at drumming 
	2) hopefully seen a lot of salvations and know as a christlike loving man 
	


i need to start writing content for real
blog on apologetics 
i need ot be a writer? 

i guess if i really cared about the harvest ministry i'd knwo that my time here is now and that evangelism and growing people and really being a light and encouragement that God matters more and empowering them and being charistmatic is so important 

it's probably ebtter to do one thing well than do so many random things. 

agh i just feel so unloved in my minsitry
its like my time and effort is unappreciated
me organizin gthanksgiving food + hotpot ingredients 

we're probably landing at 9 (3 hours from now )

what's some of the most loving things I can do for life gorup
	i can buy them chicken 
	i can deeply care about their problems and issues 
	i can create spaces where they hang out 
	 i can figure out evangelism and follow up on thanksgiving 


i mean there are always multiple opportunities for higher pay or anything 
wow money is really not the end all be all, like i can spend so much and still be so comfortable 

i need to live with an abudnance midnset 

Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone

	for the people who have wronged me do not repay them eevil with evil

Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.


exhortation is paraklesis 
paraklēsis, refers to encouraging people to live as Jesus taught and in accordance with the gospel

Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves

Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.

ive in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited
	i'm clearly conceited because of this startup stuff lol 

i need to grind devos, system design, and that's a pretty good life to be honest

napped an hour still probably 1 more hour to go 

lord i pray i can discern yoru calling i mean i do want to be in teh startup world ikjn


2) highest risk startup 
	1) 5 years
		1) probably make 200k next 2 years, then 300 + 350
			1) workign on something probably super meaningful building out tons of features 
			2) probably exactly like Dlai 
			3) idk if its really only 1% equity idk hwo tf andys stuff 20xd but even if i had lets say 400k in stock in 3 years if wed ipo that defintely would be worth 3 million and at that point am i not rich enough 
			4) i mean currently i literally have 70k in 3 years i'll probably have 300k at 25 already im literally on a path to guranteed wealth and i get to serve God in a very specific way 
			5) startup i would be really grinding all my hours for money and i'd feel pretty unloved and have little friends 
		2) hubspot is probably 150, if promoted 210, 230 250, 270/300
			1) and then i can work with karina on that path, my job is to completely transform the service maturity, critsits + postmortems space 
			2) fully remote work in taiwan learn chinese
			3) its a pretty good life can get married can still buy a house

3) optimal life 
	1) i mean if i could only choose one i rather be
