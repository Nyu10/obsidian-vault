## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


2/18 Romans 13 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves..... For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.t 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience Rebelling against authority is rebelling against God is a pretty controversial and strong warning. Admittedly lot to say about this but its late and I don't really want to go into it, I just think personally I thought the drinking age of 21 was so stupid, because if you go to asia you can drink at 18, go to canada at 19, so the only reason its illegal in the US at 21 is becasue they didn'd trust college students but making it illegal kind of just makes it more likely for kids to smuggle into dorms and be dumb (throwback to what happened to prohibition in the US). Anyways, I think this verse is actually really complex and super interesting to think about, especially through the lens of other controversial historical uprisings


Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.


he night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh. [
