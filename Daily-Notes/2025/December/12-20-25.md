## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

Romans 15 12/20 I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—19 by the power of signs and wonders through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalemb all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.c 20 It has always been my ambition to preach the gospeldwhere Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation. 21 Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.” 22 This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. If you've read anything about Paul, he's lowkey extremely smart, and probably one of the greatest startup founders in all time. Today's reflections will be short, but I hope my ambition can be placed towards God's kingdom rather my own personal kingdom.
