## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


didn't get to go to church because it was closed for christmas party 


if worship doesn't cost the believer something (time, ego, resources), it may not be true devotion.

Devote your time to seeing Christ

Devote your treasures to glorify him

Devote your life to submitting to Christ Our King


- **The Shift:** Devoting your time no longer means "attending church events." It means maintaining a **rhythym of prayer and reflection** when you're working 60+ hours a week.
    
- **The "Magi" Application:** Just as the Magi traveled through a "secular" desert to find Christ, you are "pursuing" Him through a secular career. If you can keep your integrity and your "inner life" intact while scaling a company, that is a high level of pursuit.


- **The Shift:** The sermon argues that the Magi gave Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh because those were their most valuable assets.
    
- **The Application:** Devoting your treasures doesn't just mean "tithing" your salary. It means using your **influence, your network, and your skills** to help others. It means not let your "equity" become your identity. If the startup succeeds, you treat the wealth as a tool for service rather than a scorecard for your worth.


This is the hardest part. The "posture" of a startup founder or early employee is often one of **self-reliance, ego, and "hustle."**

- **The Shift:** The sermon says the Magi "fell down and worshiped." This is an act of **submission**.
    
- **The Application:** You can be a high-performer in SF while maintaining a "submissive posture" toward Christ. This means:
    
    - Refusing to lie to investors or cut ethical corners.
        
    - Treating your coworkers with a dignity that isn't tied to their productivity.
        
    - Recognizing that your success (or failure) doesn't change your standing with God.
