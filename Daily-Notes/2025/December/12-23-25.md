## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

Oh lord I don’t even know what to do with my brother and mom 


I’m being manipulative because I’m so mature 

And clearly my mom is crazy and suicidal and so upset and wants to remove me from the will because of who I marry 

My mom has huge idols of blessing in this earth like Harvard and being a doctor 


She’s idolizing our outcomes and not letting us live in our sin 

If she is focused on your brother’s "sin" while she is threatening your inheritance and emotionally blackmailing you with her own life, she is neglecting her own spiritual state.



Feel like it’s so bad that I told my mom 
There was no reason for me to be so in depth about that 
God I’m so sorry for we are all bound by sin even my mother and I didn’t think about the impact that it would change my family dynamics
