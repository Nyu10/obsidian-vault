## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


reflection

- **Your Top 3 Wins:** What actually went right this year? Big or small.
    
- **What You Are Proud Of:** Maybe you handled a difficult situation with grace. Maybe you finally set a boundary.
    
- **Who Supported You:** Who listened when you were venting? Who picked up the slack? Text them right now and say thank you.
    
- **What You Are Grateful For:** Look outside of work. Your health. Your family. A quiet morning.

I"m grateful that i'm healthy
that i have a home away from home
that i have a church and spiritual family that is there for me if i really need it even if it's transaction and i'm using them




wow christmas is really a tiem where families get together
so many probelms in life 
this dude to my left is 36 
and it's just so surreal because at teh end of this world there's really only like a few people that genuienly care about you 
even jacob's life is clearly not much better than mine even though he makes. alot of money 



- **The "Supermarket Ad":** This is still the #1 way. Print out a simple flyer in Chinese and English. Go to **SkyFoods** or **New York Mart** on Main St. They have boards specifically for room rentals.
    
- **WeChat Groups:** If you or your mom speak Chinese, join local Flushing community groups. Search for "法拉盛租房" (Flushing Rentals) in the WeChat search bar.
    
- **Senior Centers:** Since your uncle is 70, you might want a tenant who is also older or respectful of seniors. You can contact the **Selfhelp Flushing Community Campus** or the **CPC (Chinese Planning Council) Senior Centers**. They often have seniors looking for affordable "home-sharing" situations.
    
- **The "Home Sharing" Program:** New York has a specific program called the **NY Foundation for Senior Citizens Home Sharing**. They match people over 60 who have extra rooms with "vetted" roommates. It’s safer than a random person from the street.
