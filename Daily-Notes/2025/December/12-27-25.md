## 🙏 Time With God

### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?

I am thankful for my job because it provides stable income that allows me to save $30k a year, guaranteeing my future financial security and freeing me from immediate financial stress."
I pray and know that this does not mean my security is in money, but taht GOd has provided and i am forever grateful for him allowing me to steward my life in this way 

- "I am thankful for the wisdom and discipline God has given me (and the environment that fosters it) to live frugally and invest consistently, which is a rare blessing."


How would your days be different? What anxieties would you face? This contrast can amplify your appreciation for your current blessings.
	if i did not have a job i'd be deseprately searchign for something constnatly ignoring friends and life group to apply to those jobs
	i'm grateful fo the time i can do to build my own life and hagn iwth kayla and attempt ministry, even if i'm not perfect at it 


### Detailed Prompts for Reflection

*   **Lessons Learned Recently/Testimonies:** *What has God been teaching me? Any recent blessings or answers to prayer?*
    (e.g., 'Remembered how God showed up in Y situation.")

i made it through february to june with 15k debt out situatoin and still doign well 

*   **God's Attributes?** *What attribute of God stood out to me today or this week? (e.g., Love, Holiness, Sovereignty, Patience, Justice)*

God is wise for he made me wise
he makes me want to steward
he makes me want to enjoy life 
he makes me want to be joyful and grateful 

*   **Did I surrender to God today?** *In what area did I release control or trust Him fully?*

If you're _guaranteed_ to be a millionaire, what control are you still trying to grasp? What anxiety about the future is driving you?

I pray that i'm surrendering my future, my webllbieng of my kids
my stewardship of this house 

- - Practice surrendering your financial future (even the millionaire status) back to God. Trusting His timing and His purpose for your resources, rather than solely your own ambition for more.
	- HOW CAN I DO THIS????


*   **Challenges and Repentance:** *Where did I fall short? What temptations did I face? What do I need to confess or repent from?*

perhaps the "rushing" needs to be redirected from _accumulation_ to _impact_ or _stewardship for His Kingdom_.
What is the _purpose_ of this guaranteed wealth? How can it serve beyond just your personal comfort?

long term i want to be charitable and help build God's kigndom through church building 


- _What specific fear or insecurity does chasing more money alleviate?_
	- that my life is useful and actually doing somethign important in my young ambitious years 
		- but you can say that's true for my undergrad ministry i am doing something useful even if its difficult		- 

- _What do I believe "more money" will truly give me that I don't already have or am guaranteed to have (security, freedom, status)?_
		shoot honestly if i had more money, i would just worry less about moms situation and retirement
		-i would eat mroe food
		- i'd be more generous
		- and i'd spend my time better instead of worryying about hwo to make more money 
- **Redefine "Enough":** From a Christian perspective, what does "enough" look like for you, personally and for Kingdom impact? If you know you'll be secure, the "rush" might be an unchecked desire for _superfluous_ wealth, which can be a spiritual trap. Gratitude helps you recognize when you _have_ enough.
	- yeah i think i'm money obsessed i want 50M because i want life to be easy and i do what i want and have my money work instead of me actually work, but I love buildign so i'll continuet o build and grow my influence in this world



What _specific thought or feeling_ is driving that urge to control or accumulate?
	i can't tell, i'm pretty sure its just i want to eat a lot of food and provide for my children and know that i'm doing something right by having a high paying job, i'm adding that monetary value to society

| **Priority** | **Book Title**                                   | **Why this order?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**        | **System Design Interview (Alex Xu)**            | **Practicality First.** This gives you immediate wins. It provides the "visual patterns" and high-level components (Load Balancers, Key-Value stores) you need to talk the talk.                                                    |
| **2**        | **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** | **The Reality Check.** Alex Xu tells you to "use a cache." This book tells you _why_ a cache works at the hardware level. It prevents you from being a "surface-level" engineer who just memorizes diagrams.                        |
| **3**        | **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces**         | **The Concurrency Masterclass.** System design is all about handling multiple users at once. This book teaches you the deep mechanics of threads and locks that make Alex Xu’s "distributed locks" make sense.                      |
| **4**        | **Designing Data-Intensive Applications**        | **The Professional Standard.** Once you've finished Alex Xu, you'll realize his book is a bit "simplified." This book is the "Level 2" version that explains the hard trade-offs (like why data replication is actually difficult). |
| **5**        | **Understanding Distributed Systems**            | **The Modern Wrapper.** This acts as the final glue, covering modern topics like Observability, Security, and Microservice patterns that round out your knowledge.                                                                  |
