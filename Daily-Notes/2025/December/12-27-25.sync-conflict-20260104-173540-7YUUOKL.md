You mentioned wanting "recognition and status." In a Kingdom context, greatness is inverted: “The greatest among you will be your servant.”

• The Conflict: Status in the world usually requires "conspicuous consumption" (fancy cars, zip codes, titles). Status in the Kingdom is often found in "hiddenness" and sacrifice.

• The Integration: You can be "great" in your career (excellence is a form of worship) without being enslaved by the status it brings. Use your career excellence to gain "seats at the table" where you can influence culture or help people, rather than just increasing your own name recognition.


 The Strategy: Use your resources to be "low-status" in your hospitality. Be the guy who washes the dishes. Be the guy who asks the deep, uncomfortable, caring questions.

• The Goal: True hospitality makes the guest feel like they are the important ones. If they leave thinking "He's so rich," you failed. If they leave thinking "I felt so seen and heard," you succeeded.


• The Secret: Whenever possible, practice hospitality in secret. * The "Covered" Mentality: When you take a group out, tell the waiter beforehand to bring you the bill. Don't make a show of it. If people ask, simply say, "I’ve been really blessed recently and wanted to celebrate with you guys." Then move the conversation back to them.


Reflective Question: If you lost your $170k income tomorrow, would your friends still want to be at your table because of who you are, or would they miss the "free stuff"? Radical hospitality builds the kind of community that stays even when the money is gone.


The first way you build the Kingdom is by being the best at what you do. In the Bible, Daniel and Joseph didn't build the Kingdom by being "professional religious people"; they built it by being so excellent at their secular jobs that kings had to acknowledge their God.

• The Action: Do not "check out" of your career because you have enough money. Work with such integrity, kindness, and skill that people ask, "Why are you like this?" * The Kingdom Goal: To earn "cultural authority." When you have high status in your field, your "testimony" carries more weight with people who would never step foot in a church.



The Kingdom Goal: To provide a "foretaste of the Banquet." People should leave your presence feeling like they just got a glimpse of how God loves them—unconditionally and extravagantly.

It will give you concrete tools for projecting the three crucial aspects of charisma: presence, power, and warmth. As you use them, you will experience an increased sense of personal magnetism—and if it was already strongly present, you’ll gain finer control over that charismatic power.

People probably don’t see me as warm and present 
I need to say hi to more people and be loving and welcoming
