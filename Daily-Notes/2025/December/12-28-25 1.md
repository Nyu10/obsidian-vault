## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes

Judgement day-
Everyone will stand before God

Evangelical and non denomination are pre trib 

• Stage 1: The Rapture (The Surprise): They believe Jesus comes "in the air" to take believers away before the Antichrist and the Mark (666) appear.

• The Argument: There are no signs for this. It is "imminent," meaning it could happen while you're reading this. This is why people say He is coming "even today"—they are talking about the Rapture, not the final Battle of Armageddon.  

• Stage 2: The Second Coming (The Schedule): This happens 7 years later, after the Antichrist, the Mark, and the Great Tribulation. This is the visible, "every eye shall see Him" event



Catholic and orthodox and reformed 
Other Evangelicals (and most Catholic/Orthodox/Reformed Christians) believe there is only one return. They agree with your logic completely.

• The Argument: In 2 Thessalonians 2:3, the Apostle Paul says, "Don’t let anyone deceive you... for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness [Antichrist] is revealed."  

• The "Today" meaning: For this group, saying "He is coming today" is more of a moral attitude than a literal timeline. It means "live as if your life could end today," or "the spirit of the Antichrist is already here, so the final act could start any moment



To give you an idea of how much the New Testament focuses on this:

• **1 out of every 30 verses: Statistically, for every 30 verses you read in the New Testament, one of them mentions the return of Christ.  

• 23 out of 27 books: Almost every single book in the New Testament (except for a few very short personal letters like 3 John or Philemon) mentions the Second Coming.  

• The 8-to-1 Ratio: Many scholars point out that for every one prophecy about Jesus’ first coming (His birth/ministry), there are roughly eight prophecies about His second coming
