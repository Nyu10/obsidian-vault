## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes


Lord I pray that kayla's meeting with mom can go well

i'm really scared to be honest, but if my mom says somethign bad i'm not going to help joseph and also joseph will see that 
need her to be the loving light and christlike as a role model to Joseph
or else there is no christianity or truth in this world


God i haven't been reading recently 


> **Philippians 4:6-7** "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

- **The Reflection:** Think of God’s peace as a literal security guard standing at the door of your mind. If she says something hurtful or out of line, visualize that peace blocking the comment from entering your soul.
	-
the peace will transcend all understanding even money can't solve our problems



> **Matthew 10:16** "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves."

- **The Reflection:** You can be kind (the dove) without being a doormat. Being "shrewd as a snake" means recognizing the patterns. If you see her starting to spiral, you have the permission to end the meeting early to protect your girlfriend’s heart.







Moses was no stranger to leading a group of difficult people. Even after rescuing them out of slavery and leading them safely away from the Egyptians, the Israelites were not happy with him. Instead of being grateful for their new freedom and provision from God, they were shedding tears over the menu ([Numbers 11:4–6](https://ref.ly/Num%2011.4%E2%80%936;esv?t=biblia)), grumbling about not having water ([Numbers 20:2–3](https://ref.ly/Num%2020.2%E2%80%933;esv?t=biblia)), wishing they had died in Egypt and could choose another leader ([Numbers 14:2–4](https://ref.ly/Num%2014.2%E2%80%934;esv?t=biblia)). Even Moses’s own siblings were jealous of his leadership ([Numbers 12:2](https://ref.ly/Num%2012.2;esv?t=biblia)) and complained to God about their brother and his Cushite wife.

Yet what amazes me about Moses is that he didn’t retaliate against this annoying group of people. He didn’t even defend himself against the harsh accusations. Instead, he demonstrated amazing humility and compassion on those he led, repeatedly interceding for them.

Moses pled with God to heal Miriam’s leprosy ([Numbers 12:13](https://ref.ly/Num%2012.13;esv?t=biblia)). He begged God to forgive Israel’s unbelief when it was time to enter the Promised Land ([Numbers 14:19](https://ref.ly/Num%2014.19;esv?t=biblia)). He lay prostrate before God, fasting forty days and nights after Aaron and the Israelites had made the golden calf to worship ([Deuteronomy 9:13–18](https://ref.ly/Deut%209.13%E2%80%9318;esv?t=biblia)).

Admittedly, there were moments when the Israelites’ constant complaints drove Moses to the brink of despair ([Exodus 5:22](https://ref.ly/Exod%205.22;esv?t=biblia); [Numbers 11:14–15](https://ref.ly/Num%2011.14%E2%80%9315;esv?t=biblia)), yet by God’s grace he persevered. And even at the very end of his life, he was still lovingly leading the disobedient Israelites.




12 Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, 13 bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive…


9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, …



God will be honored and our hearts will find deeper satisfaction as we seek to love people just as Christ loved us when we were his enemies.



But these factors could point to the book being in the tradition of Solomon’s wisdom, rather than by him.

There are several factors that point to Ecclesiastes being compiled or edited after Solomon’s lifetime ([12:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ec12.9-10)). For example, when the author speaks of injustice or oppression, he does not speak from a kingly perspective, as someone who has the power to do something about it ([3:16](https://ref.ly/Ec3.16); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Ec4.1); [5:8–9](https://ref.ly/Ec5.8-9); [7:7](https://ref.ly/Ec7.7); [8:9](https://ref.ly/Ec8.9)). Also, there are Aramaic and Persian words in the book, which were not in usage by Jewish people until their encounter with the Persians (see [note](https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:FSB?ref=Bible.Ec2.5) on [2:5](https://ref.ly/Ec2.5); [note](https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:FSB?ref=Bible.Ec2.8) on [2:8](https://ref.ly/Ec2.8); [note](https://ref.ly/logosres/LLS:FSB?ref=Bible.Ec8.11) on [8:11](https://ref.ly/Ec8.11)). These factors point to a compilation date of the book after 539 bc and perhaps as late as the third-century bc.

nor the ear its fill of hearing.

9 What has been will be again,

what has been done will be done again;[i](https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3ANIV2011/references/bible%2Bniv.21.1.6?tile=left&zzls=2eMKcwoXCkFFrw4IwFMKFw7%2FDigjDuDRpw5cKPsO0wq3Dljk6w4TCgnFPY0jDml5naMKadDdRGMOSw7%2FCvsObw6rDkMKhw5teAjk5wrnDp8K7w6fDgMO2woBWGsONwqJgw4gawqFBw4VNwpPCmMK6FsK6wrQsej3CkMOowrZaw5TDgCLDpsOnw4ZUw5bCn8OPw7lgFMOPw7jDhBfDqGTCocOAw7o8wp0%2BTsOiwqXCly5Ww4tsw7rCksKsw5JswrHDinjCtnjDimbDncOJw5nCkH3DrAA%2FWXRgTsKqbhrDisO3wq0jXUldcXBpSVpMw7cGwqVBw6nDiDp6aMObw6HDrwQJESBsAEEXw4TCkMOLXMOBIMKcFDYPwr0wwrhMw6zCo8K4LCEXSFMKZSzClGQ4wpEow5jDvA0Sw7QcwqJwck9%2Bwoc7wrgYfsOBG1zDsTpjwpTDtTfDtMK1I8O%2Fw5nCgsOrw4PCl8KGwrrCtsO0woLDkBg8wqbDk1ZRwr%2FDjsK9wpZ7bzzDrsOgwoBMERNKwp3CucK%2FGzwTwoTDl8KNw71Pw7AMdmfDr8KSLUrDq25wVMOewqB3HA3Dqyl0ScK3woFORcKeecOGbcO7w5Z%2BAU9dw4vCkg%3D%3D#)

there is nothing new under the sun.


11 No one remembers the former generations,[j](https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3ANIV2011/references/bible%2Bniv.21.1.7?tile=left&zzls=2eMKcwoXCkFFrw4IwFMKFw7%2FDigjDuDRpw5cKPsO0wq3Dljk6w4TCgnFPY0jDml5naMKadDdRGMOSw7%2FCvsObw6rDkMKhw5teAjk5wrnDp8K7w6fDgMO2woBWGsONwqJgw4gawqFBw4VNwpPCmMK6FsK6wrQsej3CkMOowrZaw5TDgCLDpsOnw4ZUw5bCn8OPw7lgFMOPw7jDhBfDqGTCocOAw7o8wp0%2BTsOiwqXCly5Ww4tsw7rCksKsw5JswrHDinjCtnjDimbDncOJw5nCkH3DrAA%2FWXRgTsKqbhrDisO3wq0jXUldcXBpSVpMw7cGwqVBw6nDiDp6aMObw6HDrwQJESBsAEEXw4TCkMOLXMOBIMKcFDYPwr0wwrhMw6zCo8K4LCEXSFMKZSzClGQ4wpEow5jDvA0Sw7QcwqJwck9%2Bwoc7wrgYfsOBG1zDsTpjwpTDtTfDtMK1I8O%2Fw5nCgsOrw4PCl8KGwrrCtsO0woLDkBg8wqbDk1ZRwr%2FDjsK9wpZ7bzzDrsOgwoBMERNKwp3CucK%2FGzwTwoTDl8KNw71Pw7AMdmfDr8KSLUrDq25wVMOewqB3HA3Dqyl0ScK3woFORcKeecOGbcO7w5Z%2BAU9dw4vCkg%3D%3D#)

and even those yet to come

will not be remembered

by those who follow them.

 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;[u](https://app.logos.com/books/LLS%3ANIV2011/references/bible%2Bniv.21.1.11?tile=left&zzls=2eMKcwoXCkFFrw4IwFMKFw7%2FDigjDuDRpw5cKPsO0wq3Dljk6w4TCgnFPY0jDml5naMKadDdRGMOSw7%2FCvsObw6rDkMKhw5teAjk5wrnDp8K7w6fDgMO2woBWGsONwqJgw4gawqFBw4VNwpPCmMK6FsK6wrQsej3CkMOowrZaw5TDgCLDpsOnw4ZUw5bCn8OPw7lgFMOPw7jDhBfDqGTCocOAw7o8wp0%2BTsOiwqXCly5Ww4tsw7rCksKsw5JswrHDinjCtnjDimbDncOJw5nCkH3DrAA%2FWXRgTsKqbhrDisO3wq0jXUldcXBpSVpMw7cGwqVBw6nDiDp6aMObw6HDrwQJESBsAEEXw4TCkMOLXMOBIMKcFDYPwr0wwrhMw6zCo8K4LCEXSFMKZSzClGQ4wpEow5jDvA0Sw7QcwqJwck9%2Bwoc7wrgYfsOBG1zDsTpjwpTDtTfDtMK1I8O%2Fw5nCgsOrw4PCl8KGwrrCtsO0woLDkBg8wqbDk1ZRwr%2FDjsK9wpZ7bzzDrsOgwoBMERNKwp3CucK%2FGzwTwoTDl8KNw71Pw7AMdmfDr8KSLUrDq25wVMOewqB3HA3Dqyl0ScK3woFORcKeecOGbcO7w5Z%2BAU9dw4vCkg%3D%3D#)

the more knowledge, the more grief.






10k MRR Goal 


### Phase 1: The "Problem Hunt" (Month 1-2)

- **Don't build yet.** Go where people are complaining: Reddit, Twitter (X), or specialized Slack/Discord communities.
    
- **The "Boring" Filter:** Look for things businesses _have_ to do but hate (tax compliance, automated reporting, niche CRM, API connectors).
    
- **Validation:** Cold DM 50 people. Ask: _"If I built a tool that solved [X], would you pay $100/mo for it today?"_ If nobody says yes, kill the idea and move to the next.
    

### Phase 2: The "Dirty" MVP (Month 3-4)

- **Ship in 3 weeks, not 3 months.** Use a boilerplate (like ShipFast or Next.js kits) to skip the boring stuff (auth, billing, DB).
    
- **AI Leverage:** Use Cursor or GitHub Copilot to code at 5x speed. Use AI for your landing page copy and initial designs.
    
- **Goal:** Get your first **5 paying users**. Manual outreach only.
    

### Phase 3: The "Grind to $1k" (Month 5-7)

- **The 80/20 Rule:** Spend 20% of your time coding and 80% on **Distribution**.
    
- **Systems:** Set up an automated cold email sequence (instantly.ai or similar) or start "Building in Public" on X to attract your tribe.
    
- **Price Up:** If you started at $20/mo, double it. If no one churns, double it again. High prices filter for better customers.
    

### Phase 4: The "Scale to $10k" (Month 8-12)

- **Negative Churn:** Focus on "Expansion Revenue." Make it so that as your customers grow, they pay you more (usage-based pricing).
    
- **SEO & Content:** Start planting seeds for organic traffic so you aren't reliant on manual DMs forever.
    
- **Affiliates:** Find influencers in your niche and give them 30% to sell your tool for you.
