## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes


I need to document the toxic and emotional abuse of my girlfriend and whether or not i shoudl break up with her 

1) she is extreemyl spoiled so she is entitled to things and expectatiosn without communicating it. However, the worst part is when she gives attitude and treats me, and her father as below human due to her lack of respect for us as humans. SHe would never treat her friends like this.

Today, when she picked up car, she was upset abotu the charging, then argued abotu the $45 then told me i should ahve took the michigan flyer, but those weren't the problems the problem was in the way she keeps sayign i don't care i don't care, constantly makign comments attacking me that imply i'm a bad boyfriend like how come. you don't get mango mochi, how come you're not thinking of me (when i literally do so fkn much for her)

she's so fkn selfish and self centered. and somehow whenever i vocalize this she doesn't fucking care, she just ignores it and continues to give attitude. and then onyl till i cried today at 130PM she finalyl left and seperated. 

look, my flesh wants to make up with her just because short term she did have a good new years thing to plan, and then tis gonna be so hard this smester if we break up, but long term, that's not a person who i want to raise my children. she doesn't inspire me, she's emotionaly immature, i think i'm constantly trying to fix her, she's no charistmatic or friendly to people anymore she doesn't try that much and she's so sheltered. she's not ambitious she doesn't see the world and career as important and she doesn't even do devos regularly and she's a life gorup leader desciplign 4 people somehow, but she's so much in her sin. 


 I don't think going back to new york the life style is great either, i mean i'll just play ping pong
 be a workaholic
 live with family who si fkn toxic even more so then kayla, brother is sucidal, mom is a gaslighter and toxic also and financiaally fucking terrible crazy and not a spiritual leader shes terrible tbh 

tbh i think i shoudl mvoe to SF and start my life there as long as my rent isn't that bad


1. - Beyond the car incident, can you recall 2-3 **other specific, detailed instances** where you felt "constantly flamed" or treated "as below human"? Describe the situation, her exact words/actions, and your immediate physical and emotional reaction.

The worst time was when I was driving to planet fitness with her and i said i didn't want to live and she said go crash the car then

even when i was paying for omakase she was being slightly mean and annoyed to mother and I even though it was supposed to bea. happy time and experience 

she aslo never takes responsibility for her life in terms of career, improving her attitude towards me

oh every single time on mondayu we were walkign we were constantly bickering about some BS like how i'm lugging her luggage but she's till nto happy or satisfied about em or some bs 

- How do these specific instances make you feel about yourself, about her, and about the relationship? (e.g., small, worthless, angry, confused, hopeless)


that i'm in absuive toxic relationship now, that shes fkn immature and i dont' deserve this fkn disrespect
and obviously in her head she probabyl thinks she doesn't deserve my disrespect of not beign the best boyfriend or something (btu i fuckn do so much for her literally my car is for ehr me stayign in michigan is for her i dont' hagn out with anyone but her to be honest)

we're lowkey actually not compatible, it jsut feels like a sunk cost because for 2 years we dated and we literalyl gone through so much her becoming illegal immigrant for a bit because of visa situation, somehow we overcame my moms preconcieved biases of hating international studenst and koreans and her in particular (my mom was crazy callign her the devila dn how my mom needs to remarry and leave her 2 sons my mom was fkn crazy and we somehow overcame that )

    - You mentioned she "would never treat her friends like this." What specific behaviors does she exhibit towards you (or her father) that are _never_ directed at her friends? What does that discrepancy communicate to you?

attitude, passive aggressive ness, active agressiveness, constant frustration 


- When you vocalize your feelings (e.g., that she's selfish/self-centered), you mentioned she "doesn't fucking care, she just ignores it." What does "ignores it" look like in practice? (e.g., changes topic abruptly, stonewalls, physically leaves, gives a blank stare, minimizes your feelings ("you're too sensitive"), or denies your reality?)

i'm the one who taught her to physcially leave, that was my toxic trait, she jsut ocntinues to be fkn toxic bro i'm tellign you what disorder does she have?


She just expects me to do things without communicating it and when i don't fulfill it she thinks she has a right ot fkn be annoyed upset and disrespect me, this past 5 days its been 90% sad times 10% actually normal (but not even fkn happy and lively which i defetneiyl was and seh broguth me todwn to her level to deal with her bs ), like yes relationships are not all super joyful times, btu theyr'e alos not suppsoed to be fkn always depressing and then oh oh oh the most recent argumentm was her getting super fkn upset that i wasn't flyign abck to michgian with her (even though i literally came a day after,) and the reason was because i jut came back from puerto rico on teh 23rd and then i wanted to stay till at least jan 3rd in nyc (stayed only till 31 as a compromise) because family obviusly had problems and i needed to help them out relationally, btu seh jsut wanted what she fucking watned and then got so upset at me for not "caring" abotu her, when ltieralyl me staying a few extra days could be the difference of them killing themselves vs not and she just doesnt fkn care she just wants me to fly back wtih her because i'm only fkn userful to her and she doesn't actauly love me she only watns what i can give her


it usualyl turns into me getting upset, adn then slowly forcing an apology out of her because i feel like i deserve it

she almsot never acknowledges her role 

im' always constnatly tryign to fix her tbh while she thinks i'm the problem 


- Are there ways you might be enabling certain behaviors, even unintentionally (e.g., consistently giving in to demands out of a desire for peace, apologizing even when you feel wronged, trying too hard to please)?
	- yes i'm enabling by still being with her even though i cosntlanly fucking say how wrong it is to treat me like this 
		dude even key west i literally paid for allt eh food, and she barely fkn acknowledges and thanks me for it becuase she was so stressed about idfk not her classes, some elena BS or planning colorodao or New york trip? it was so stupid we had such a nice vacation palnned but seh wasn't presenta nd was so fkn distraacted then what was the poitn adn she apologized at the end but it was an ok time not because of me but becuase of her failure to be prsent and happy given how many fkn resources were poured in 


- If you stripped away all obligations and short-term plans, what would be the core joy, peace, or satisfaction you derive from being with her?
	- when she's good to me she'sa. hpapy companion that's down to travel and enjoy food and such


- If nothing about her behavior or the relationship dynamic changed, what would your life realistically look like in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years? Picture your daily interactions, your spiritual life, your family life (if you raise children with her), and your overall sense of peace.
	- lol we would get a divorce 100% this is intolerable i can't be fkn talkign to a blank wall therest of my life this is unacceptable 


New years day
	write bingo cards that we watn to accomplish
	lunch and dinner
	movie
	and a kiss
	this shit is not something i really need 
	i do need my groceries back though 

- **Choose the Time and Place Wisely:** A public place or somewhere you feel safe, where you can leave easily. Not your shared apartment if there's any concern.
- **Inform a Trusted Friend/Family Member:** Let someone know you're doing this and where/when, so they can check on you.

i've learned that i'm still insecure and that i fall back into the same habbits of making my girlfriend my best friend, without making sure my life is in order



but I've reached a point where I cannot continue in this relationship if things don't fundamentally change. The way I'm being treated is deeply hurtful, unacceptable for my well-being, and not the foundation for a healthy future."


- "The constant attitude, passive-aggressiveness, and the way you express frustration – it feels like you treat me and your father "below human." You never treat your friends this way. This disrespect towards me needs to stop."

When I told you I didn't want to live, and you said 'go crash the car then,' that was abusive and truly traumatizing. It showed a complete lack of empathy and care for my life. That's a point where I realized how broken things are."


- "When I try to tell you how I feel – for example, that I feel you're being selfish or self-centered – you often ignore it, dismiss it, or act like you don't care. It makes me feel worthless, unheard, and leaves me feeling like I'm talking to a blank wall."
- **Specific Example:** "Your reaction to my family's crisis, where I needed to stay to support potentially suicidal family members, vs. your unmet desire for me to fly back with you – that demonstrated a profound lack of empathy for what I was going through and what my family needed."

"I constantly feel attacked, like I'm a 'bad boyfriend,' for not fulfilling expectations you never communicate.

"I feel like I'm constantly trying to fix things
I put so much effort into this relationship – my car, staying in Michigan, paying for trips – and I often feel it goes unacknowledged or unappreciated. A relationship needs to be a partnership, with mutual effort and respect, not one-sided."


1. **Respectful Communication:** "I need you to speak to me with respect, without attacks, passive-aggressiveness, or constant frustration, especially when we disagree."
2. **Active Listening & Empathy:** "I need you to genuinely listen when I share my feelings, acknowledge them, and apologize specifically and sincerely when you've hurt me, without deflecting or blaming me. I need to see empathy from you."
3. **Taking Initiative & Accountability:** "I need you to take genuine responsibility for your own emotional maturity, your life goals (like career), and your role in our conflicts. This includes actively seeking growth and potentially professional help for communication or emotional regulation, if you find yourself struggling."
4. **Spiritual Alignment (Briefly):** "For a future together, I need a partner who is genuinely pursuing spiritual growth and living it out, not just leading a group but acting in ways that reflect our faith's values."



- "My decision is firm. I've thought about this deeply. This isn't open for debate right now. I need you to seriously consider everything I've said."
- **(Be prepared for her reaction: anger, tears, denial, promises. Do not get pulled into arguing. Just repeat: "This is my truth. This is what I need." Keep your composure.)**
