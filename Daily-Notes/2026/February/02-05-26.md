### Purpose driven life

#### chapter 16 what matters most 
life is all about love

Love is the secret of a lasting heritage 
Truly I tell you jsut as you did it to one of the least of those who are members of my family you did it to me

Your time is your life 
- **Priority Check:** Busyness often replaces what actually matters—loving God and people.
- **Love = Action:** It’s measured by how you treat people, not what you claim.
- **Point to Ponder:** Life is all about love.
- **Verse to Remember:** “The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.” Galatians 5:6b (NIV)
- **Question to Consider:** Who in my life needs more intentional love from me right now?




Today’s culture of independent individualism has created many spiritual orphans—“bunny believers” who hop around from one church to another without any identity, accountability, or commitment. Many believe one can be a “good Christian” without joining (or even attending) a local church, but God would strongly disagree. The Bible offers many compelling reasons for being committed and active in a local fellowship.

### Why You Need a Church Family

**A church family identifies you as a genuine believer.**  
I can’t claim to be following Christ if I’m not committed to any specific group of disciples. Jesus said, **“Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.”**

When we come together in love as a church family from different backgrounds, race, and social status, it is a powerful witness to the world. You are not the Body of Christ on your own. You need others to express that. **Together, not separated, we are his Body.**

Your love for one another will prove that you are one of my desciples

### Day 17: A Place to Belong
- **Designed for Community:** You weren’t made to walk with God alone.
    
- **Church = Family, Not Event:** It’s participation, not attendance.
    
- **Growth Happens Together:** Isolation weakens faith; connection strengthens it.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** I belong in God’s family.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “You are members of God’s very own family.” Ephesians 2:19b (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What keeps me from deeper connection with other believers?



## **Day 18: Experiencing Life Together**

- **Real Fellowship:** More than small talk — sharing life, struggles, and joy.
    
- **Authenticity Matters:** Healing begins when people stop pretending. 
- **Mutual Growth:** We are shaped through encouragement, confession, and prayer together.
- **Point to Ponder:** I need others in my life.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “Let us not give up the habit of meeting together.” Hebrews 10:25a (TEV)
- **Question to Consider:** What fears keep me from being real with others?
	- i'm not real with ohters because my life is garbage
## 🧍‍♀️ **Day 19: Cultivating Community**
- **Unity Takes Work:** Community doesn’t happen naturally — it’s built intentionally.
- **Protect Relationships:** Choose humility over pride, peace over ego.
- **Grace Over Perfection:** Everyone’s unfinished, including you.
- **Point to Ponder:** Relationships are worth fighting for.
- **Verse to Remember:** “Make every effort to keep yourselves united.” Ephesians 4:3 (NLT)
- **Question to Consider:** What habit of mine damages unity?
For where two or three have gathered together in my name i am in their midst

if you are a member of a small group or class, I urge you to make a group covenant that includes the nine characteristics of biblical fellowship: **We will share our true feelings (authenticity), encourage each other (mutuality), support each other (sympathy), forgive each other (mercy), speak the truth in love (honesty), admit our weaknesses (humility), respect our differences (courtesy), not gossip (confidentiality), and make group a priority (frequency).**

## **Day 20: Restoring Broken Fellowship**

- **Conflict Is Inevitable:** What matters is how you respond, not that it happened.
    
- **Act Quickly:** Delay deepens division.

## **Day 21: Protecting Your Church**

- **Church Is Fragile:** Unity is easily broken by pride, gossip, and division.
    
- **Be a Peacemaker:** Don’t fuel conflict — heal it.
    
- **Serve the Mission:** Focus on what builds the body, not what tears it down.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** I will protect God’s family.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “Do your best to preserve the unity of the Spirit.” Ephesians 4:3a (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What can I do to strengthen, not strain, my community?

if a fellow believer hurts you go and tlel him work it out between the two of you
if he listens you've made a friend
if he won't listen take one or two others along so taht the presence of witnesses will keep things honest and try again
if he still wont listen tell the church

To change your life you msut chagne the way you think


WOW I Feel like i really need to start memorizing bible verses to take myself to the next level 
WE need to be doers of the word not just listeners
even though i'm so tempted lord I need to know that it' snot as satisfying and sustaining as obeying your commandments


If you reach a student, you reach their future marriage, their future parenting, and their future career for the next 50 years.
Jesus spent 3 years with 12 "students" who were mostly teenagers and twenty-somethings. He didn't seek a throne in Jerusalem. He sought a small group in Galilee.

If God is infinite, there is no such thing as a "small" assignment from Him. A "low" role given by a High King is still a royal commission.

Am I enough if I am just a child of God, or do I need to be a 'Success' to be okay?"
Help me believe that being Your son is a higher 'status' than any platform the world could give me.



You just need to provide what a father provides: **Security, Identity, and Challenge.**
- Notice things about them that they don't notice about themselves. Say things like, _"I see the way you handled that conflict; you have the heart of a peacemaker,"_ or _"I see your discipline; God is going to use that."_
- **The Message:** "I see who you really are, even when you can't see it yet."
- **The Practice:** Be the person who is always there at the same time, at the same table. Even if they don't value it now, they are "recording" your faithfulness.

- **The Message:** "I am not going anywhere." (This shatters the "orphan" fear that everyone eventually leaves).

Think of it this way: An **idol** is what you are chasing, while a **stronghold** is the wall that keeps you from leaving that pursuit.
the stronghold is the **false logic** that keeps you trapped in that service.

- **The "Vertical" Connection:** Because no human is clapping for you, your heart is forced to look up. You realize, _"God saw that. And His 'Well done' is actually enough."_
    
- **The Proof of Sonship:** A "servant" needs a performance review to know they are safe. A **son** knows his Father is watching and is already pleased. Hiddenness proves you aren't a "performer" for a crowd, but a child in a family.






#### Psychology
**The Study of "Mattering":** Dr. Gordon Flett, a leading researcher on perfectionism, identifies "mattering" as a core human need. When people don't feel they matter naturally, they develop **"Mattering Compensations."** They try to become indispensable through work or success so that they can finally feel safe.
