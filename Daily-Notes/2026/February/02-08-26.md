## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


I’m actually the worst for not doing devos 
And forgetting to text her 
Lord I pray for her heart 


“And Nehemiah continued, “Go and celebrate with a feast of rich foods and sweet drinks, and share gifts of food with people who have nothing prepared. This is a sacred day before our Lord. Don’t be dejected and sad, for the joy of the Lord is your strength!””
‭‭Nehemiah‬ ‭8‬:‭10‬ ‭NLT‬‬

She’s actually unbearable I actually try so hard and she treats me like this 


### Prayer

I’m waking up actually so sad

Understanding repentance

- ﻿﻿(metamelomai): to have regrets about something, in the sense that one wishes it could be undone
- ﻿﻿(metanoeo): change one's mind;  
    feel remorse
- ﻿﻿Repentance: turning away from sin and towards God

Repentance is agreeing with God on reality 
Some sins that are real sins and spiritual damaging that I should take seriously 


- ﻿﻿Questions to ask ourselves
- ﻿﻿How does my view of reality need to change?
- ﻿﻿Do I recognize sin as sin?
- ﻿﻿Do I see God as better?
- ﻿﻿Is there a different reality God wants me to see?
