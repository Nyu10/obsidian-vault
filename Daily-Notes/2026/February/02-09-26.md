## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

God
why am i so bad and terrible
makes me so sad
feel like i'm so lonely while working

Wow why am i so tempted

### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?
*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group

pray for family
for brother, that really just pisses me off
i want to disown them
he can squander the house i don't care i rather build my own life then take care of liabilities

**Clearing the Temple:** He finds that a high priest has allowed an enemy (Tobiah) to move into a Temple storeroom. Nehemiah literally throws the furniture out into the street.

[Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.](https://www.bibleref.com/Nehemiah/13/Nehemiah-13-14.html)
