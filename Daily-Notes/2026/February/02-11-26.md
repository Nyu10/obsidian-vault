## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos



### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?
*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group


Lust isn't just "finding someone attractive"; it's the internal choice to treat another person as a tool for your own gratification rather than a human being with a soul.
**Emotional Lust:** Seeking out a specific person’s attention just for the "ego boost" or "thrill" of the attraction, even if you don't intend to act on it.

**Dishonesty:** Telling your boss you're sick when you just want a day off, or "forgetting" to tell your partner about a large purchase you made.
	i guess i partially want athe day off from LG but i am also sick
Selfishness: scrolling on your phone while someone is trying to tell you something deeply important to them.
	on your phone at a party counts? 
		did joongi sharing vulnerably make me sad because he was the center of attention and i wanted to sleep or did i genuienly feel sad for him, i was sad at my own family situation tbh more than his, but then again i make hella money and can provide for myself
**Pride:** Refusing to apologize to your child or spouse because you don't want to lose your "authority" or admit you were wrong.
	this is em in every fight tbh i always never comfort and i just rage
**Greed:** Keeping the extra change when a cashier makes a mistake in your favor, or obsessing over getting a "better" car just because your neighbor got one.
	not givng back the extra money
> **The Litmus Test:** Ask yourself: _"If everyone here did what I am doing right now, would this party be a lonely room full of silent people looking at glass?"_ If the answer is yes, it’s a sign that you’re withdrawing your "self" from the community.
- **Self-Preservation:** If her texts are toxic, manipulative, or if she uses you as an unpaid therapist for "lifetime burdens" that you cannot fix, stepping back is often a matter of mental health. You cannot pour from an empty cup.
    
- **Prioritization:** If you are focusing on your own spouse, children, or work, and her constant texting is an interruption to your primary responsibilities, choosing not to engage isn't "sloth"—it's management.
