*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group


Lust isn't just "finding someone attractive"; it's the internal choice to treat another person as a tool for your own gratification rather than a human being with a soul.
**Emotional Lust:** Seeking out a specific person’s attention just for the "ego boost" or "thrill" of the attraction, even if you don't intend to act on it.

**Dishonesty:** Telling your boss you're sick when you just want a day off, or "forgetting" to tell your partner about a large purchase you made.
	i guess i partially want athe day off from LG but i am also sick
Selfishness: scrolling on your phone while someone is trying to tell you something deeply important to them.
	on your phone at a party counts? 
		did joongi sharing vulnerably make me sad because he was the center of attention and i wanted to sleep or did i genuienly feel sad for him, i was sad at my own family situation tbh more than his, but then again i make hella money and can provide for myself
**Pride:** Refusing to apologize to your child or spouse because you don't want to lose your "authority" or admit you were wrong.
	this is em in every fight tbh i always never comfort and i just rage
**Greed:** Keeping the extra change when a cashier makes a mistake in your favor, or obsessing over getting a "better" car just because your neighbor got one.
	not givng back the extra money

mom constnatly asks for help
hoenstly doesn't make me really want to be in this family anymore
my life is not for joseph when he self chooses his own pain tbh

my dad's depression and failure was never my fault
maybe i could have cheered him up but that defintely was not enough in of it itself


yalalllalala
