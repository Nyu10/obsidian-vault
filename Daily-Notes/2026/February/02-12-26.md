Lord 
i'm so fkn sad
cuz i know all this bs my mom is going through
is such an emotional waste for myslef
and i dont' want ot be her son
and i guess i'm living a luxurious life
but shes living a miserable one
and she begs me to come back not because she actually wants the best for me
but because she's lonely
its like how i ask kayla when shes coming back not cuz its best for her
btu cuz i need her

i need God not AI to heal me
for i knwo my family is terrible
yet they gave me teh potential to be where i am right now


You are responsible for being a kind, supportive son (**to** her), but you are not responsible **for** her emotional state or her daily happiness. That "property" belongs to her.

- **Healthy Care (Connection):** You visit, you help with the lawn, you call to check-in, and you are there for the big emotional moments. The parent still has their own hobbies, friends, and a life that doesn't depend entirely on the child's presence.
    
- **Enmeshed Care (Control/Dependency):** The parent's entire emotional well-being is tied to the child. If the child goes on a date, travels, or spends time with friends, the parent feels abandoned or "hurt," and uses that hurt (guilt) to pull the child back.

"I'm sorry you're feeling lonely, Mom. I love you, and I'll see you on Tuesday." You acknowledge her feeling without canceling your plans to fix it.

connecting her to others.
