Lord 
i'm so fkn sad
cuz i know all this bs my mom is going through
is such an emotional waste for myslef
and i dont' want ot be her son
and i guess i'm living a luxurious life
but shes living a miserable one
and she begs me to come back not because she actually wants the best for me
but because she's lonely
its like how i ask kayla when shes coming back not cuz its best for her
btu cuz i need her

i need God not AI to heal me
for i knwo my family is terrible
yet they gave me teh potential to be where i am right now
