**The 15-Minute Rule:** When the urge hits, tell yourself you can't act on it for 15 minutes. Usually, the peak of the "craving wave" passes in that time.

**A Note on Perspective:** Real intimacy is about being known and seen. Lust is about consuming an image. One leaves you full; the other leaves you empty. Aim for the "full."
