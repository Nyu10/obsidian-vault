## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos



### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?
*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group



Lord genuinely
My flesh wants to play catan
my flesh lusts
my flesh wants to watch useless youtube and movies
but non of that is ultimatley sustaining
i need soul care
and freedom from care of my family
not ignorance
but an overjoy of love even when my enemies are terrible

READ Psalm 26:1–5. 1 Vindicate me, LORD, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the LORD and have not faltered. 2

i am not blamaeless and i have faltered

Test me, LORD, and try me, examine my heart and my mind; 3

protect my mind and soul 

for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.

your love never fails even when i fail 

4 I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites. 5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked. THE SECRET OF TRUE INDEPENDENCE. When David calls himself “blameless” he does not mean “sinless,” because in verse 11 he begs for mercy. Rather, as king he is charged falsely with corruption, with allying with evil men, and with taking bribes (verses 4–5, 10). By calling out to God to be his judge, he appeals neither to his friends to defend him nor to his enemies to change their minds. This is the secret of true independence, as Paul found when he said he cared not at all what people thought—friends or foes—nor even how he assessed himself. “It is the Lord who judges me” (1 Corinthians 4:4). 

it is the lord who judges me i need to remmember
God let me think of the oppinions of you on how i spend my time not of others 



Only God’s opinion counts. Prayer: Father, I confess that the opinions of others matter far more to me than does yours. I fear looking bad. Help me to remember how accepted I am in Christ—so I will have the freedom and poise necessary to live without fear. Amen.



### Purpose Driven lfie


## **Day 28: It Takes Time**

- **No Shortcuts:** Spiritual maturity is a journey, not a sprint.
    
- **Be Patient with Yourself:** God isn't finished with you yet; growth is often incremental.
    
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Focus on the "today" instead of the mountain of "tomorrow."
    
- **Point to Ponder:** There are no shortcuts to maturity
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “Everything on earth has its own time and its own season.” Ecclesiastes 3:1 (CEV)
    
- **Question to Consider:** In what area of my life do I need to be more patient with God’s timing?

a husband who is faithful to his wife most of the time is not faithful at all! your habits define your character

keep a journal of lessons learned

God's never in a hurry but he's always on time

habakuk "if it seeems slow do not despair for these things will surely come to pass just be patinet
they will not be overdue a single day"

When you don't have a heart for what you're doing you are easily discouraged

a simpel life in the fear of GOd is better than a rich life with a ton.of headaches

## **Day 33: How Real Servants Act**

## **Day 34: Thinking Like a Servant**

- **Self-Forgetfulness:** Humility isn't thinking less of yourself; it's thinking of yourself less.
    
- **Identity in Christ:** When you know you are a child of God, you don't have to prove your worth through status.
    
- **Service as Training:** Every act of service is a "workout" for your character.

## **Day 35: God’s Power in Your Weakness**

- **Vulnerability is Strength:** God’s power shows up best when we admit we can't do it on our own.
    
- **Stop Pretending:** Being "real" about your struggles (like your tooth pain or job anxiety) allows God to work through you.
    
- **Boast in Weakness:** Your scars are your greatest ministry tools because they prove God’s grace.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** God loves to use "weak" people.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” 2 Corinthians 12:9a (NIV)
