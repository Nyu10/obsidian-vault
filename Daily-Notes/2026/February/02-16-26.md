Lord genuinely
My flesh wants to play catan
my flesh lusts
my flesh wants to watch useless youtube and movies
but non of that is ultimatley sustaining
i need soul care
and freedom from care of my family
not ignorance
but an overjoy of love even when my enemies are terrible

READ Psalm 26:1–5. 1 Vindicate me, LORD, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the LORD and have not faltered. 2

i am not blamaeless and i have faltered

Test me, LORD, and try me, examine my heart and my mind; 3

protect my mind and soul 

for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.

your love never fails even when i fail 

4 I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites. 5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked. THE SECRET OF TRUE INDEPENDENCE. When David calls himself “blameless” he does not mean “sinless,” because in verse 11 he begs for mercy. Rather, as king he is charged falsely with corruption, with allying with evil men, and with taking bribes (verses 4–5, 10). By calling out to God to be his judge, he appeals neither to his friends to defend him nor to his enemies to change their minds. This is the secret of true independence, as Paul found when he said he cared not at all what people thought—friends or foes—nor even how he assessed himself. “It is the Lord who judges me” (1 Corinthians 4:4). 

it is the lord who judges me i need to remmember
God let me think of the oppinions of you on how i spend my time not of others 



Only God’s opinion counts. Prayer: Father, I confess that the opinions of others matter far more to me than does yours. I fear looking bad. Help me to remember how accepted I am in Christ—so I will have the freedom and poise necessary to live without fear. Amen.
