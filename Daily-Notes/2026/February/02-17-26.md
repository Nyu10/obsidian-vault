## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos



### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?
*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group


**Skill Acquisition**Learning something hard (like a new instrument or a sport) forces your brain out of autopilot.


**Social Stakes**Host something. A dinner party, a board game night, or a walk. Other people are unpredictable—and unpredictability kills boredom.
