Proverbs 16

To humans belong the plans of the heart,  
    but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue.
All a person’s ways seem pure to them,  
    but motives are weighed by the Lord.
Commit to the Lord whatever you do,  
    and he will establish your plans.
The Lord works out everything to its proper end—  
    even the wicked for a day of disaster.
    The Lord detests all the proud of heart.  
    Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.
		  help me not be proud because I am promoted
		  for God you're the giver of all life and Grace



Lord takes pleasure when we're wlaking in teh right direction
