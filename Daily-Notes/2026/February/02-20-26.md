### **Day 36: Made for a Mission**
- **Your Mission:** You were made for a mission on earth, which is to introduce others to God. This mission is a continuation of Jesus' work and is a duty for every believer, not just pastors.
- **Point to Ponder:** I was made for a mission.
- **Verse to Remember:** "In the same way that you gave me a mission in the world, I give them a mission in the world." John 17:18 (Msg).
- **Question to Consider:** What fears have kept me from fulfilling the mission God gave me? What is one thing I can do to start sharing the Good News with others?


### **Day 37: Sharing Your Life Message**

- **Personal Testimony:** Your "Life Message" consists of your testimony (how you began a relationship with Jesus), your life lessons (the truths God has taught you), and your shared passions (the issues God shaped you to care about).
- **Point to Ponder:** God wants to say something to the world through me.
- **Verse to Remember:** "Be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you, but do it with gentleness and respect." 1 Peter 3:15-16 (TEV).
- **Question to Consider:** As I look at my personal story, who does God want me to share it with?
    

### **Day 38: Becoming a World-Class Christian**

- **Global Perspective:** A "world-class" Christian moves from self-centered thinking to God-centered thinking and from local thinking to global thinking. God wants his whole church to take the whole gospel to the whole world.
- **Point to Ponder:** The Great Commission is my commission.
- **Verse to Remember:** "Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind." Psalm 67:2 (LB).
- **Question to Consider:** What steps can I take to prepare to go on a short-term missions experience in the next year?


### **Day 39: Balancing Your Life**

- **The Five Purposes:** Spiritual health requires keeping five purposes in balance: Worship, Fellowship, Discipleship, Ministry, and Evangelism. You can stay on track through small groups, regular evaluation, and journaling your progress.
- **Point to Ponder:** Blessed are the balanced.
- **Verse to Remember:** "Live life with a due sense of responsibility, not as those who do not know the meaning of life but as those who do." Ephesians 5:15 (Ph).
- **Question to Consider:** Which of the four activities (small groups, evaluation, journaling, or passing it on) will I begin in order to stay on track and balance God’s five purposes for my life?
    

### **Day 40: Living with Purpose**

- **A Purpose Statement:** Living on purpose is the only way to really live; everything else is just existing. You are encouraged to write a "Life Purpose Statement" that summarizes God’s five purposes for your life and defines your direction.
- **Point to Ponder:** Living with purpose is the only way to really live.
- **Verse to Remember:** "For David... served the purpose of God in his own generation." Acts 13:36 (NASB).
- **Question to Consider:** When will I take the time to write down my answers to life’s five great questions? When will I put my purpose on paper?
