## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


Serve the LORD with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling. 12 Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

Psalm 2 5 12 
GOd is an angry God if we do wrong things
i shouldn't be so bad


To become wise is to become a disciplined person, given not to

impulsiveness but to self-examination, to circumspection, and to clear

thinking. It is to become a resilient person who through hard knocks has

become poised and resourceful. As an athlete becomes physically

competent only after rigorous training, so wisdom is hard won.

**King Jehoshaphat** of Judah and **King Ahab** of Israel.
