## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


Revelations 8
slightly burntt out by hyper productivity, need caffiene and real gym time rpobably

**silence in heaven for about half an hour.**
Silence for half an hour 
1. **peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.** These are classic biblical signs of God's presence, power, and impending judgment.



- **Unshakeable Conviction:** Having personally seen or heard such things would yield an unshakeable conviction, enabling them to endure immense suffering and persecution for the sake of the Gospel.
They were entrusted with God's message for humanity, requiring faithfulness, careful transmission, and courageous proclamation.


"Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people..." (v. 3) The angel doesn't just stand there; he is given "much incense" to mix with the prayers. This suggests that the prayers are tangible objects in heaven. They are collected, held in a precious gold vessel, and brought to the very center of power—the altar in front of the throne. This shows that nothing is lost; every prayer is accounted for. "Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth..." (v. 5) This is the most critical part. The same vessel (the censer) that held the prayers is now filled with fire from the altar and thrown back down to earth. The Symbolism: The fire represents God's holy judgment and power. The Connection: By using the same container, the text shows a "cause and effect" relationship. The prayers went up, and in direct response, God’s power comes down. The thunder, lightning, and earthquakes that follow are the physical "echoes" of God responding to what His people asked for. ^from AI A main theme of revelations 8 is how God handles our prayers, stored in Gold, the physical representation of them really extenuates how important prayer actually is. It might be one of the only things in our life times that are permanent. I remember when Tim Keller was about to pass he said that his regret was that he wish he would have prayed more -- I hope and pray that all of our prayer lives can forever be growing and so does our intimacy with God.


Lord help me be radically generous
i think long term i rather work remote and be overemployed than for a startup in SF 
like i rather be in Ann Arbro I'm pretty srue
Reminds you that God owns _everything_ – "the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession." He is the ultimate Giver.

God gave me everything, his one and only son and gave me the onyl thing that matters, salvation and intimacy with him


Generosity is hindered on fear
	fear of not having enough or being able to eat nice and drive a tesla
		while this is a comfort thing for myself, i'm saving up riches for myslef because i believe that i need to supply my own future when God ultimately controls how much i make, what my future ministry will look like and how my kids could also provdie for me 
	God is my security not my roth ira, 401k, house, or moms life insurance money
		peace in michigan is way better than in new york to be honest 
	

Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s

January 4

READ Psalm 3. 1 LORD, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! 2 Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.” 
3 But you, LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high. 
	thank you for lifting my head high lord

4 I call out to the LORD, and he answers me from his holy mountain. 5 I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the LORD sustains me. 6 I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side. 

	tens and thousands persecute me, which is really my brother
7 Arise, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked. 8 From the LORD comes deliverance. May your blessing be on your people. PEACE AMID DANGER. David’s son Absalom was trying to kill him. The seeds of that family dysfunction are David’s own fault. He had wanted Absalom’s love so much he never corrected him, even when Absalom murdered one of his brothers. Now David is fleeing to save his own life. In this prayer he realizes that neither a son’s love nor popular acclaim can serve as a person’s worth or security. David relocates his glory and hope to God and finds peace despite danger. God is the only one who sustains you, whether an army is pursuing you or you are at home in your own bed. God sustains every breath you take. 

Prayer: Lord and Savior, I am facing so many troubles, some of my own making. But I can hold my head up because I am your child and servant. So be my shield—protect me. And be my glory—give me confidence that you are with me and will bring me through this. Help me! Amen.



Let me quickly read jan 4 wisdom


Another aspect of wisdom is insight (Hebrew bina)
To be wise is to recognize multiple options and possible
courses of action where others can imagine only one or two.

You can’t be deeply changed by shallow spirituality 


Like 10:38-42

I am anxious and troubled about many things, let me chose Jesus and not worry about this scam of life insurance 

Let me rest and pray for the houses are definitely liabilities, so is uncle Paula nd mom and so I pray that we’ll have enough money 


Martha was a person of peace v38
Mary have Jesus her undivided attention 
Martha was distracted v40
Was resentful 
Not focused on Jesus for serving but compassion and resentment 

Anxious & troubled
