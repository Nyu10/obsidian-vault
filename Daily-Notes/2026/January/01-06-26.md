## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes

I swear
I will never ever cheat on an OA again
i rather fail with dignity and integrity
promise me that lord

READ Psalm 5:1–6. 1 Listen to my words, LORD, consider my lament. 2 Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray. 

it feels so bad to say but i cry for help due to my financial obsession since i want to be free from it or so comfortable that i'm happy with teh girnd, lik einstead of grinding leetcode i'm grinding soemthing productive

3 In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly. 4 For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome.

i was really wicked today with my cheaitn gon the OA if i just thougth about it i might've been able to get it, defintely not teh actual code though lol 

5 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong; 6 you destroy those who tell lies. 

i am a liar and a cheater and i am sorry

The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, LORD, detest. POURING OUT OUR HEART.

Many of the psalms begin with desperate “laments”—cries for help from deep within. This is uncensored prayer, straight from the heart. Even when we have no words to express our anguish, we can lay our requests before God. 

He expects us to come to him for refuge from our grief, fear, and pain and not to dull those emotions with amusements and distractions that promise, but can never deliver, blessing. 

thank you for letting em workout today with kayla it was very fulfilling 

We are to have confidence that he is the God who told Moses that he would faithfully commit himself in love to us, in grace, despite our sins and flaws (Exodus 6:7). Prayer: All-knowing Lord, you see what is in my heart. All-powerful Lord, I don’t have the power to accomplish what needs to be done, so I spread out my requests before you. 

i can not accomplish it on my own i can't even wake up at 8, at 9 i'm going ot be doing my devos, buying my mom, and then leetcode

All-wise Lord, I know you hear and will act—but I know also I must wait on your wise timing, and so I will. Amen.



True wisdom requires deep knowledge of the Scriptures. Even Jesus based his every
move on the Bible, quoting Scripture to face and explain his death
(Matthew 27:46; Psalm 22:1). How can we be wise without being immersed
in the Word of God?

How can you take steps to greatly increase your knowledge of the Bible?
In what other areas of life should you be reading now?

if i had true wisdom i woudln't have cheated

**The Meaning:** It highlights the biblical theme that the "righteousness" of a father can sometimes provide a lingering blessing or mercy for his descendants, even if those descendants fail to live up to that legacy.

When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, hears her son is dead, she doesn't mourn. Instead, she sees an opportunity to take the throne for herself.

- **The Massacre:** To ensure no one can challenge her, she orders the execution of **all her own grandsons** (the "royal seed"). She wants to end the line of David entirely so she can rule as Queen.

- **The Rescue:** Ahaziah’s sister, Jehoshabeath, sneaks into the palace during the massacre. She grabs a baby named **Joash** (Ahaziah’s son) and hides him.
    
- **The Secret:** For six years, while the wicked Athaliah rules the land, the rightful heir to the throne is hidden in the Temple of God, being raised in secret by the High Priest.

- **The "Sour Grapes" Shift:** Later in the Bible, God clarifies this. In **Ezekiel 18**, He says people should stop using the proverb, _"The parents eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge."_ He explicitly states that a son will not bear the guilt of the father.
    
- **The New Testament Perspective:** For those in the Christian tradition, **Galatians 3:13** says, _"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us."_ Theologically, this means any "curse" is broken the moment you choose a different path with God.

I didn't pray for the OA and God is redirecting em clearly


- **Hezekiah:** His father, Ahaz, was one of the worst kings in history (he even closed the Temple). Hezekiah chose to be the opposite, reopening the Temple and leading a spiritual revival.
    
- **Josiah:** His father and grandfather were famously wicked, but Josiah became a hero of the faith by rediscovering God’s Word and changing the nation's direction.
