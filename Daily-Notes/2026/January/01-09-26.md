## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes

Sermon on John 15:1-17
To bear spiritual fruit, abide in Christs love 

Do you want to bear fruit ?


""I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."
‭‭John‬ ‭15‬:‭5‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Character: The "Fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22–23), specifically Love, which Jesus commands in verse 12.

• Mission: Bringing others into the kingdom and "going and bearing fruit" that lasts (v. 16).

• Obedience: Jesus equates abiding in his love with keeping his commandments (v. 10).
