revelations 16-18

2 chronciles 30 return of the passover

- **The Prayer:** Hezekiah prayed for them: _"May the good Lord pardon everyone who sets his heart to seek God... even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."_
    
- **The Result:** The Bible says the Lord heard Hezekiah and **"healed the people."** This highlights that God values a sincere heart over perfect ritual adherence.
The celebration was so successful that the people decided to extend the festival for **seven additional days.**
- **The Scale:** Hezekiah and his officials provided thousands of bulls and sheep for the feast.
- **The Comparison:** The text notes that there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem since the time of **Solomon** (about 250 years earlier).    
- **The Final Blessing:** The chapter ends with the priests blessing the people, and the author notes that their prayer "came up to His holy dwelling place, even unto heaven."

so sad, tmr is booked but i'm still coding 

They smashed **sacred pillars**, cut down **Asherah poles**, and tore down **pagan altars**.

- They made sure that every priest and Levite—including their wives, children, and even toddlers—received their fair share of the food. No one was left out, from the oldest to the youngest.
"He did what was good and right and faithful before the Lord his God. And in every work that he began... he did it with all his heart. **So he prospered.**"

And the Lord sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the commanders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons, his own flesh and blood, cut him down with the sword

- **The Failure:** Parallel accounts in _2 Kings 20_ and _Isaiah 39_ tell us what happened: Hezekiah didn't talk about the God who healed him. Instead, he showed the Babylonians his **silver, gold, spices, and armory.**
    
- **The Root Issue:** Hezekiah’s heart had become proud. He wanted to impress the Babylonians with his wealth and power rather than his God. He was showing off the _gifts_ but ignored the _Giver_.

God you are my giver
i have everything from you, my amazing job

**The Insight:** This reveals a profound theological truth about human nature: **Judgment alone does not change a heart.** * **Meaning:** Many believe that if God "showed Himself" through power, everyone would believe. Revelation 16 proves the opposite—those who have committed themselves to "the Beast" (worldly systems and self-worship) become so hardened that they would rather curse God in agony than surrender to Him.
