## ✍️ Quick Reflections & Other Notes


Chapter 1:
It all starts with God
	purpose is onyl looking outward
	- tue purpose is found through **revelation**—what God has revealed in the Bible, our "Owner's Manual".    
- **Key Insight:** You were made _by_ God and _for_ God. Until you understand that, life will never make sense
- **Point to Ponder:** It’s not about me.
- **Verse to Remember:** "Everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him." Colossians 1:16b (Msg).
- **Question to Consider:** In spite of all the advertising around me, how can I remind myself that life is really about living for God, not myself?.
Chapter 2
- **Planned Conception:** Long before your parents thought of you, God conceived of you in His mind. While there are "unplanned" pregnancies, there are no "unplanned" children by God.    
- **Motivation:** God's motive for creating you was His **love**.
- - **Point to Ponder:** I am not an accident.
- **Verse to Remember:** "I am your Creator. You were in my care even before you were born." Isaiah 44:2 (CEV).
- **Question to Consider:** Knowing that God uniquely created me, what areas of my personality, background, and physical appearance am I struggling to accept?.
#### **Day 3: What Drives Your Life?**
- **Common Drivers:** Many people are driven by guilt, resentment, fear, materialism, or the need for approval.
- **Benefits of Purpose:** Knowing your purpose gives life **meaning**, **simplifies** your decisions, **focuses** your energy, **motivates** you, and **prepares you for eternity**.
- **The Final Exam:** One day, God will ask two crucial questions: "What did you do with my Son, Jesus Christ?" and "What did you do with what I gave you?" .
Warren argues that most people are driven to leave a "legacy" on earth (monuments, money, being remembered). He dismisses this as short-sighted, famously quoting James Dobson: "Given enough time, all your trophies will be trashed by someone else!".
- **Point to Ponder:** Living on purpose is the path to peace.
- **Verse to Remember:** "You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you." Isaiah 26:3 (TEV).
- **Question to Consider:** What would my family and friends say is the driving force of my life? What do I want it to be?.


Dad asked same question ^
wasted oppportunities





Day 4: made to last forever
**Changing Values:** When you live in light of eternity, your values change; you prioritize relationships and character over fame or wealth.
- **Point to Ponder:** There is more to life than just here and now.
- **Verse to Remember:** "This world is fading away, along with everything it craves. But if you do the will of God, you will live forever." 1 John 2:17 (NLT).
- **Question to Consider:** Since I was made to last forever, what is the one thing I should stop doing and the one thing I should start doing today?.

Day 5 
- **Life is a Test:** God constantly tests your character, faith, and love through problems and success.    
- **Life is a Trust:** Everything you have—time, money, talents—is on loan from God. You are a **steward** of His property.
- **Point to Ponder:** Life is a test and a trust.
- **Verse to Remember:** "Unless you are faithful in small matters, you won't be faithful in large ones." Luke 16:10a (NLT).
- **Question to Consider:** What has happened to me recently that I now realize was a test from God? What are the greatest matters God has entrusted to me?.




#### **Day 6: Life Is a Temporary Assignment**
- **Spiritual Foreigners:** Earth is not our permanent home; we are "pilgrims" or "ambassadors" passing through.
- **Discontentment:** We feel a sense of dissatisfaction on earth because we were made for something better; a fish is never happy on land because it was made for water .
LOL is this why i'm discontent with remote life and my personal life here in ann arbor
- **Point to Ponder:** This world is not my home.
- **Verse to Remember:** "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." 2 Corinthians 4:18 (NIV).
- **Question to Consider:** How should the fact that life on earth is just a temporary assignment change the way I am living right now?.






#### **Day 7: The Reason for Everything**
- **The Glory of God:** The ultimate goal of the universe is to show God's glory.
- **Fulfilling Purpose:** We bring God glory by worshiping Him, loving other believers, becoming like Christ, serving others, and telling others about Him .
- **Point to Ponder:** It’s all for him.
- **Verse to Remember:** "For everything comes from God alone. Everything lives by his power, and everything is for his glory." Romans 11:36 (LB).
- **Question to Consider:** Where in my daily routine can I become more aware of God’s glory?.
#### **Day 8: Planned for God’s Pleasure**

- **The Definition of Worship:** The first purpose of your life is to bring enjoyment to God. This is what worship is.
- **Worship as a Lifestyle:** Worship is far more than music or church services; it is a lifestyle of doing everything for God's glory.    
- **The Target:** Worship is not for our benefit; it is for God’s benefit. We don't worship to "get something out of it" for ourselves.
- **Point to Ponder:** I was planned for God’s pleasure.
- **Verse to Remember:** "The Lord takes pleasure in his people." Psalm 149:4a (TEV).
- **Question to Consider:** What common task could I start doing as if I were doing it directly for Jesus?.
