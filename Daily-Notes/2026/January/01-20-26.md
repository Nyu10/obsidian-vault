## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

The "lowest task" isn't about being mediocre; it’s about **who gets the glory** for your excellence.

- **The Challenge:** Do you pray for those members as much as you prepare for the lesson?
    
- **The Cost:** Spending an hour of your "free 4 hours" on your knees for the specific hang-ups and sins of your group members is exhausting and invisible. It's much harder than just showing up to lead.

Is my private life really holy praying for members constantly and the people in my life
