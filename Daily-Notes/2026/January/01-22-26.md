## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos


January 22 READ Psalm 16:1–6. 1 Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge. 2 I say to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.”

YOU ARE MY LORD APART FROM YOU I HAVE NO GOOD THING 

3 I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.” 4 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more. I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips. 5 LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure. 6 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. IDOLS THAT DESERT. We may not believe in literal divine god-beings of beauty, wealth, pleasure, or fertility. But we must all live for something, and if we live for and love any thing more than God himself, we are trapped. They become things we have to have, so we “run,” exhausted, after them. But this leads to increasing suffering (verse 4), for life inevitably takes them from us. Instead we must make God our portion (our real wealth), our cup (our real pleasure), our ultimate good. Prayer: Lord, I want the gifts of your hand more than the glory of your face. I can root my happiness in amusements, music, food, or nice weather. But let suffering enter the picture, and they show themselves as the tawdry baubles that they are. Without your constant presence and favor, no thing is a “good thing.” So I receive them with thanks, but I rest my heart and hope in you. Amen.



Ezra 1
Acts 1

lol i haven't read ezra in so long 

Cyrus practiced religious tolerance allwoing exiled Jewish people to rebuild their temple

[12But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.](https://www.bibleref.com/Ezra/3/Ezra-3-12.html) [13No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.]
they were a small remnant living under Persian rule.
So sad tbh 

- **Ezra 1–3:** They arrive and lay the Temple foundation.
    
- **Ezra 4:1–5:** Local enemies harass them; work on the **Temple** stops.
    
- **Ezra 5–6:** Prophets Haggai and Zechariah tell them to get back to work; the **Temple** is finished (516 BC).
    
- **Ezra 4:6–23:** (The "Flash-Forward") Decades later, they try to build the **City Walls**, and Artaxerxes shuts them down (this is the drama that leads into the book of Nehemiah).



Ezra 2 
Act 2




Purposeful driven life

### **Day 9: What Makes God Smile?**

- **God’s Pleasure:** God smiles when you trust Him, obey Him wholeheartedly, praise and thank Him continually, use your abilities, and love others.
- **Example:** Noah made God smile by trusting Him completely—even when it made no sense.
    
- **Not Perfection:** God doesn’t expect perfection, but **direction**.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** God smiles when I trust Him.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “The Lord smiles on those who fear him, on those who hope in his unfailing love.” Psalm 147:11 (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** Which of the five actions that make God smile can I begin practicing today?
    

Noah was a pelasure to the Lord

### **Day 10: The Heart of Worship**

- **True Worship:** Real worship is offering yourself fully to God—mind, body, will, and emotions.
    
- **Problem:** We often worship “selectively,” giving God only what’s convenient.
    
- **Romans 12:** Worship is a daily decision, not a feeling.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** The heart of worship is surrender.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “Offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him.” Romans 12:1b (TEV)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What area of my life am I holding back from God?

Retirmenet is nto the goal of a surrendered life 
you cannot serve both God and money 
Wherever your treasure is your heart will be also 

help me think about waht is God's best interest
is it best interest to help justin
is it best interest to practice drums or leetcode or fast

Sometimes it takes years but eventually you discover that the greatest hindrandce to God's blessign in your life is not others, it is yourslef your self-will stubborn pride, and personal ambition 
You cannot fulfilil God's purposes for your life while focusing on your own plans 

Paul I die daily
From this day forward I am a slave of Jesus christ lol 


Practicing teh Presence of GOd
I need to pray for Gods to give me the words to speak instead of relying on my own ability

### **Day 11: Becoming Best Friends with God**

- **God Wants Relationship:** God doesn’t want religion; He wants friendship.
    
- **Biblical Friends of God:** Abraham, Moses, David—ordinary people who spoke honestly with God.
    
- **Closeness Requires:** Constant conversation, meditation, honesty, obedience, and trust.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** God wants to be my best friend.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “You are my friends if you do what I command.” John 15:14 (NIV)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What practical step can I take today to deepen my friendship with God?

Remain in my love 
when you obey me you remian in my love just as i obey my father and remain in his love

### **Day 12: Developing Your Friendship with God**

- **Conversation All Day:** Friendship with God grows through continual awareness, not just quiet time.
    
- **Honesty Matters:** God can handle your anger, doubts, and questions.
    
- **Obedience = Intimacy:** We grow closer to God by obeying what we already know.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** I am as close to God as I choose to be.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “Draw close to God, and God will draw close to you.” James 4:8a (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What can I do to remind myself to think about God more often throughout the day?
    

confessing
singing 
shouting
standing in honor
kneelign dancing making joyful noise, testiifying, playign instrumeents, raisign hands

### **Day 13: Worship That Pleases God**

- **God Looks at the Heart:** Not style, volume, or emotions—God values sincerity and truth.
    
- **Two Essentials:** Worship must be **spirit-led** and **truth-centered**.
    
- **Beyond Feelings:** Worship is a choice, especially when you don’t feel like it.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** God wants all of me.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.” John 4:23a (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What matters more to God right now—my form of worship or my heart condition?

	worship takse effort and sacrifice, praising God even when you don't feel like it

### **Day 14: When God Seems Distant**

- **Spiritual Dryness:** God sometimes feels far to test faith, develop perseverance, and deepen trust.
    
- **Common Mistake:** Chasing feelings instead of truth.
    
- **What to Do:** Keep praying, keep trusting, keep obeying.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** God is real, regardless of how I feel.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “He has said, ‘I will never leave you; I will never abandon you.’” Hebrews 13:5b (TEV)
    
- **Question to Consider:** How can I stay faithful even when God feels distant?
baby christian a lot of confirming emotions and answers self centered prayers lol 

Tell God exactly hwo you feel 
Focus on who God is his unchangign nature

### **Day 15: Formed for God’s Family**

- **You Belong:** God created you to be part of His family—the Church.
    
- **Not Optional:** Spiritual growth doesn’t happen in isolation.
    
- **Biblical Metaphors:** Body, family, bride—Christianity is relational.
    
- **Point to Ponder:** I am not alone.
    
- **Verse to Remember:** “So we are all members of one body.” Romans 12:5 (NLT)
    
- **Question to Consider:** What step can I take to connect more deeply with other believers?

If you want, next we can:

- Tie **specific days** to what you’re wrestling with (career ambition, Ann Arbor discontent, legacy anxiety)
    
- Turn this into a **1-page personal rule of life**
    
- Or keep going **Days 16–21 (belonging, fellowship, love in action)**
