## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos

Sermon 
Jonah 4-1:-11
Jonah actually died ?

The stifles we most avoid are ofren the places where God is trying to meet us 

Stop running from God and Seeking deeper intimacy 

What have you been avoiding talking to God about 

What questions might God be asking you

How is God changing your heart and perspective 



## 🙏 Time With God

### Devos
> _"Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there... even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast."_ (Psalm 139:7-10)


Spent a good amoutn of tiem reflecting at least 
ahh i guess i'll read one psalm 
i sinned
and you gave me the consequences 

READ Psalm 16:7–11. 7 I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. 8 I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

help me keep eyes on you Lord i am so terribley sinful 

9 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, 10 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay. 11 You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, 

help me have joy in your presence

with eternal pleasures at your right hand. 

there are eternal pleasures i can be having but i don't cuz i'm sinful 

THE BEST IS YET TO COME. If God is our greatest good, we get what can’t be lost and will only increase—infinitely. The Lord is at our right hand. To be at someone’s right hand is to be their advocate in court or support in battle or companion for a journey. In Christ this is all literally true (Acts 2:24–36). Because he died and rose for us, he is our representative in heaven (so we are completely forgiven) and companion on earth (so we are intimately loved). And someday we will not just sense him at our side but see him face to face. In our resurrected bodies that will be endless, unimaginable pleasure (verses 9–11). Now we have nothing to fear. Prayer: Lord, as I lay down in sleep last night and rose this morning only by your grace, so keep me in a joyful, lively remembrance that whatever happens, I will someday know my final rising—the resurrection—because Jesus Christ lay down in death for me and rose for my justification. Amen.


READ Psalm 17:1–9. 1 Hear me, LORD, my plea is just; listen to my cry. Hear my prayer—it does not rise from deceitful lips. 2 Let my vindication come from you; may your eyes see what is right. 3 Though you probe my heart, though you examine me at night and test me, you will find that I have planned no evil; my mouth has not transgressed. 

you examine me at night and know that i am itchy and that i have sinned and lied to kayla
and the only way to get clean is to stop sinning and tell you the truth 

4 Though people tried to bribe me, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent through what your lips have commanded. 5 My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not stumbled. 6 I call on you, my God, for you will answer me; turn your ear to me and hear my prayer. 7 Show me the wonders of your great love, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their foes. 8 Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings 9 from the wicked who are out to destroy me, from my mortal enemies who surround me. A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. David is not claiming to be sinless as a human; he is denying that he is corrupt as a ruler. He has not lied to his people (verse 3) or taken bribes (verse 4). He is being falsely accused but his conscience is clear. How can we always keep a clear conscience? There are two parts to it. Do the right thing. But when you don’t, immediately repent, knowing that you are “the apple of [God’s] eye.” In Christ, astonishingly, God does indeed see us as perfect (Philippians 3:9–10). 

God sees us as perfect?

So whether you are falsely accused or fallen and recovered, you can walk with your head up. Prayer: Lord, help me to not care so much what others think of me. But help me to not even care so much about what I think of myself. Remind my heart that when you look on me you find me “in Christ” and see beauty. Let me rest in that. Amen.

- **Hidden in the Shadow:** Verse 8 asks God to "hide me in the shadow of your wings." This is an image of complete protection and intimacy.
    
- **The Mirror of Christ:** You mentioned **Philippians 3:9–10**, which explains that our "perfection" is not a self-made righteousness. Instead, it is a "credited" righteousness. Because of Christ, when God looks at a believer, He sees the perfection of His Son.



Woww
literally my whole weekend is gone
and i spent so much time rotting or hating my self and causing problem with kaylas

### Prayer
*  **Gratitude:** *What am I thankful for today?
*   **Prayer For Others:** *Myself, Family, Friends, Work, Life Group



Thoughts on eating as social connection
**The Result:** You aren't just paying for the calories; you're paying for the 2 hours of conversation, laughter, and bonding that happen over those calories.

**The Strategy:** If you want the most "bang for your buck," spend on food when it involves **people you like** or a **new flavor/environment** you've never tried before.


- **The Buffer:** If you have a solid social connection, you can go home and talk about it. As you feel "heard" and supported, your body literally switches back to a calm state.
    
- **The Damage:** People who are lonely stay in a low-level "fight-or-flight" state constantly. This chronic stress gradually wears down the immune system and damages the cardiovascular system.


It was their **level of satisfaction in their relationships.** People who were the most satisfied in their relationships at 50 were the healthiest (physically and mentally) at 80.


I think I need to serve more 
to make myself feel more useful

#### on eggs
3 eggs a day 
**Protein Absorption:** Your body absorbs about **90%** of the protein in cooked eggs, but only about **50%** in raw eggs.

**The "High-T" Creamy Smoothie Recipe:**
- **3 Hard-Boiled Eggs:** (Peeled and cooled—keep some in the fridge so they're ready).
- **1 Frozen Banana:** (This is key for masking any egg flavor and adding sweetness)
- **1 cup Milk or Almond Milk.**
- **1-2 tbsp Peanut Butter or Cocoa Powder:** (Strong flavors that pair perfectly with the creaminess of the egg).
- **1 Kiwi:** (Since we know this helps with the protein digestion and sleep later!).


## friendship audit 


- **The "Qualities" Audit:** List the top 3 traits you want in a best friend (e.g., loyalty, dark humor, adventurousness). Now, ask yourself: _"Do I consistently model these 3 traits for others?"_

Some topics to talk about, self-improvemennt, better descipleship, table tennis, credit card churning, traveling, dating, computer science, personal finance, drums, reading books liek charisma or effecive java

funny, empowering friend, relatable, fun to be around, very smart, reflective, probably charismatic tbh, someone who actually cares


- **The Energy Check:** Think about your last three social interactions. Did you leave the other person feeling more energized or more drained? Best friends are usually "energy donors."

i was talking to these 2 sophomore girls for the first time and it was really awkward the conversation lol 

Is this quesiton emplying i should make people more energized also? 


ask them what they're "nerding out" on lately.
	ask people waht they're caring about and nerding out on 


_Action:_ Invite a casual friend to do something totally unrelated to how you met (e.g., "I know we usually just grab coffee, but do you want to go on a random hike this Saturday?").
	ping pong friend to dinner? 


**Practice "Aggressive Checking-In"** In adulthood, the #1 friendship killer is "out of sight, out of mind."
	yeah i'm really bad at this because i don't text people back often its my worst trait i read it and i don't respond, i don't know why its like i actualyl kidn of dont care aboout them or its liek too mentally annoying to reply at the moment but i still mentally have a reply i just never send 

- **Who makes me feel like the best version of myself?** (Spend 2x more time with them).
	    i realyl don't know if its my girlfrined, I think P Josh helps empower me a lot for the Gospel and to be better and try harder to be honest
	    but i think i just need ot know i'm loved by God idk 
- **Who do I feel "performative" or fake around?** (Spend 2x less time with them).
	 performative? idk work? LOL 
    
- **What is one "brave" thing I can share with a friend this week to deepen our trust?**
		i have hella family problems that i just don't want to share about it, its not wroth it its like almost too present in my life and mind even though i guess it shouldn't really affect the day to day that much i just let it mentally consume my headspace 


#### advice on it

"What’s the most interesting thing you learned this week?" or "I’ve been thinking a lot about [Substantial Topic], what’s your take on it?"
	I guess I could ask about what they're learnign and school 
and then talk about wahts happenign in the bible i'm reading or anything 

Real "hours-long" talk usually happens when two people are **solving a problem together.**
	interesing I haven't really asked Patty like is there anything hes worried about or cares about i haven't heard his thoguths abotu descipleship or how he's growing or feels

#### charisma tips
Read the charisma myth 


**The "Eye-Contact Smile"**When you first see someone, look at their eyes, then smile. It signals that you are glad they are there (Warmth).


Instead of asking "What do you do?", ask "How did you end up in that line of work?" -> Use how

#### Presence, Power, and Warmth







#### for fasting tmr

Go with the **Egg Drop Method**. Use 2–3 eggs in your broth. It technically ends the "fast" because of the calories, but it keeps you in the "liquid" category, fuels your testosterone, and provides the glycine and fats you need to actually get into deep REM sleep.
