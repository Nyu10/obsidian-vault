Saturday morning 
Discipline of biblical honesty -> adopted from lecture by Professor Ron Walborn


Colossians 3:9-> do not lie 

Ephesians 4:14-15 speaking the truth in love 

Ephesians 4:25-27 do not let the sun go down 

James 5:16 confess your sins 


The church was called to be the light of the world. We were called to walk in the light and cast out the darkness. But in our battle, we dimmed and some have turned off our light.

We hide. We make excuses. We cover up. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to reignite the heart of honesty. Living without secrets. -PY



Wow he’s kind of wise about hiding it will
Blow it up at the worst time 


The Three Values of an "Alethea" Lifestyle

1. Truth Confronts the Sin of Hypocrisy

Hypocrisy is presenting one thing on the outside while something different is happening on the inside.

- ﻿﻿Matthew 23:27-28: "Woe to you... hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead... you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."
- ﻿﻿"You are as sick as the secrets you keep."- John Bradshaw


2. Truth is Necessary for Real Healing Whether emotional, physical, or spiritual, complete healing demands deep honesty.

Psalm 51:6: "Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place."

Note: Many people are hindered in their growth because they aren't embracing honesty in a deep way. God wants to meet us in that "secret place."


3. True Love Requires Truth

"People want to be loved, but for love they present a false version of themselves."

The Dilemma: If you pretend to be someone you are not, and someone loves that person, you will not feel loved because they are loving the "false me."

1 John 1:6-7: "If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie... But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of esus... purifies us from all sin."




Spiritual Warfare: Secrecy is the Stronghold

The father of lies, the prince of darkness want to lead you into secrecy. He knows in secrecy you will become isolated and ashamed. He wants you to live in dishonesty that will lead to darkness and destruction. Sooner or later secrecy will come to the light.

Leverage: The enemy uses hiddenness as leverage to accuse and condemn you.

Examples: Ananias and Sapphira and Achan as warnings about the cost of hiddenness.



How are things to your soul?

The Three Stages of Honest Accountability (Dr. Walborn/Seamands)

Stage 1: The Initial Unloading (The Plateau Stage)
At this stage, the focus is primarily on the relief of confession, but it often lacks the depth needed for lasting change.
- ﻿﻿The Action: You share the pain, the defeat, the addictions, and the secrets. There is power in simply "unloading" the burden.
- ﻿﻿The Experience: You feel a temporary period of hopefulness because the secret is out.
- ﻿﻿The Risk: If the person you share with is immature, or if both of you lack the tools for transformation, the progress plateaus.

Stage 2: Strategic Partnership (Iron Sharpening Iron Stage) This level moves beyond just "talking" and enters into a "fight" for freedom.

- ﻿﻿The Maturity Shift: Both parties desire victory, not just the emotional release of sharing.
- ﻿﻿The Action: You search together for strategies to win. You do

"whatever it takes" to find a breakthrough.

• The Partnership: If you need help from an elder or a professional counselor, you seek it out together.



Stage 3: Total Honesty & Radical Pursuit (The Biblical

Freedom Stage)

This is the highest level of accountability where the "old self" is completely stripped away.

- ﻿﻿The Commitment: There are zero secrets. You possess a bone-deep belief that you will do anything the Lord requires to be free and healed.
- ﻿﻿The Radical Search: You actively hunt for freedom through:
- ﻿﻿Godly mentors and spiritual directors.
- ﻿﻿Targeted seminars and biblical literature.
- ﻿﻿Spiritual disciplines: Fasting and prayer.
- ﻿﻿The Goal: You are no longer just managing a problem; you are pursuing a total transformation in Christ.


Accountability group -> about you and Christ 

- ﻿﻿1. Why is honesty so hard for leaders?
- ﻿﻿2. What is the risk of being honest?
- ﻿﻿3. What is the risk of not being honest?

In short sermon was a lot about lust 
And I’d probably say i can take away a lot from it and even so since im a leader i need to be more accountable 

I love money and want more so I can be secure and have some value, kind of hate my family 
Played catan and sports betting 



Second Saturday sermon 

The journey of biblical grieving to biblical hope 

- ﻿﻿"To provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor." - Isaiah 61:3 (NIV)
- ﻿﻿Grieving is not the final destination; healing is. God's intent is to take the "ashes" of our losses and transform them into a "display of His splendor."- Dr. Walborn

Theology of Power and Pain

Dr. Walborn emphasizes that we must have a balanced theology.

- ﻿﻿Theology of Power: Healing, miracles, and breakthroughs.
- ﻿﻿Theology of Pain: Dealing with suffering, mystery, wounds, and disappointments.
- ﻿﻿The Reality of a Broken Heart:
- ﻿﻿"The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." - Psalm 34:17-18 (NIV)

Biblical Examples

Jesus as our Model:

- ﻿﻿John 11:35 (NIV): "Jesus wept." Even knowing he would perform a miracle, Jesus validated the pain of loss through tears.
- ﻿﻿Gethsemane: Jesus experienced deep, agonizing grief, showing that spiritual maturity does not mean the absence of sorrow.

The Book of Lamentations: Jeremiah (the "weeping prophet") wrote these sorrowful poems after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C

Grief journey progression in Psalms

Psalms of lament:

Psalm 6 - Physical pain, tears, exhaustion

Psalm 7 - Being falsely accused

Psalm 13 - "How long, Lord?" (abandonment)

Psalm 88- Unanswered prayer

Grief Leading to Biblical Hope:

1. ﻿﻿﻿Remembering God - Psalm 77
2. ﻿﻿﻿God's nearness - Psalm 34
3. ﻿﻿﻿Quiet trust - Psalm 23

Biblical grief is not the absence of faith-it is faith refusing to lie.


Ground Rules for Biblical Grieving

To grieve in a way that leads to life, we must follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

"Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." — Psalm 139:23-24 (NIV)


Ground Rules for Biblical Grieving
- ﻿﻿Psalm 139: 23-24: Not Alone but through the Holy Spirit
- ﻿﻿No Blaming
- ﻿﻿No Self Absorption
- ﻿﻿Biblical Grieving into Biblical Healing not into unhealthy loop of victim mentality
- ﻿﻿Not everything but as the Holy Spirit leads. His time. His way.
- ﻿﻿Safe Biblical Advisers. Safe Biblical Community.
- ﻿﻿Grief into dependance in Christ. Not grief into self absorption and selfish care.

Five Important Questions About Grief

1. ﻿﻿﻿What brings about the need for grief?
2. ﻿﻿﻿Why is grieving necessary? What happens if we do not grieve?

	1. ﻿﻿﻿We Deaden Our Hearts
	2. ﻿﻿﻿We Compartmentalize Our Lives

3. Why do we avoid the grieving process 
4. What options does our past pain leave us 
	1. Hiding or denial 
	2. Rationalization 
	3. Anger and bitterness 
	4. Addictions 
	5. Biblical and mourning 

Not gonna lie, when other peoples parents pass at very normal ages like 85 I don’t really care tbh 
-> even people who have a normal loving family is a huge privilege they take for granted 

I’m probably a rationalist even though I don’t know what that means in this case 


Tbh I sometimes think my suffering is worse than others and I pity party myself a bit 
Dad died at 16, no father obese he was 54 
Mom is crazy in 300k debt at 65
Brother is suicidal

Kind of much easier to cut them off tbh

-> when he was talking about crying his parents for salvation even though his dad was an elder 



"Blessed are those who mourn; they shall be comforted." That's the unexpected news: there is a blessing hidden in our grief. Not those who comfort are blessed, but those who mourn! Somehow, in the midst of our tears, a gift is hidden. Somehow, in the midst of our mourning, the first steps of the dance take place. Somehow, the cries that well up from our losses belong to our songs of gratitude.

Proactive vs reactive 

What are the benefits of Biblical grieving?

6. ﻿﻿﻿It helps us to live proactively instead of reactively.
7. ﻿﻿﻿It increases your emotional capacity to handle life and people more fully.
8. ﻿﻿﻿It gives you freedom and permission to risk again and set big goals.
9. ﻿﻿﻿It keeps your heart soft and gives you empathy for other's losses.
10. ﻿﻿﻿It restores your capacity to trust God and people again.

Practical steps

- ﻿﻿Write the losses in your life... Things that have not gone the way you thought it would go...your dreams...your hopes...your disappointments...chronological or where there is most pain.
- ﻿﻿Write the list. Don't stop just keep going. Go deeper. When it feels uncomfortable keep moving into your pain and disappointments with the Holy Spirit...inside out!
- ﻿﻿Find a safe person. Be a safe person. Pray for a safe community. Pray for a safe person. Jesus is the safe person pour your heart to Him.
- ﻿﻿Keep a regular journal of honesty. Remember our goal is not to stay in grief but find hope in grief as we find Jesus there.

4th sermon

Am I serving out of overflow 



I shared that if an 85 year old dies I don’t care
But if it’s someone young I do

I guess what’s problematic about my viewpoint is that I really don’t love my mom and brother to sacrificial extents 

I don’t know if I’m doing what my dad did starting his own family and failing instead of trying to heal his old one 

I feel like there’s nothing to do in my situation 

Honestly find mom church and therapy 
Same for brother 
But I’m appalled they don’t self resource

Deliverance for brother 
They need to take ownership of their lives 
My brother is toxic and abusive 
He plans to leave my mom when he gets married anyways so he literally is just leeching and leaving …
