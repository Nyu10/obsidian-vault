Plan -> quickly finish monopoly deal
write stories about what to say about it 
then finally interview prep hard 



### 1. The Interview Reality Check

According to Mechanize's hiring page, the process is:

- **Stage 1:** Intro & Culture (30m) + a simple puzzle.
    
- **Stage 2:** Technical Screen (30m) – LeetCode style (Python) or a design discussion.
    
- **Stage 3:** The Technical Interview (1 hour) – **The "Difficult Problem."** This is where the "1800 Codeforces" level comes in.
    
- **Stage 4:** Take-home (4 hours) – Building a web app where you **are allowed to use AI coding tools**.
    

### 2. The Study Plan: CP-31 vs. Constructive Algorithms

You should combine them. Do not try to solve random 1800s. Instead, do this:

- **Focus on the CP-31 Sheet (specifically the 1400–1600 rated ones):** These problems are curated to teach you the specific "building blocks" of high-level reasoning.
    
- **Prioritize the "Constructive Algorithms" tag:** In your interview, the "Difficult Problem" is likely to be a logic puzzle where you have to build a specific answer (a "construction") rather than just searching for one.
    
- **Why 1400-1600 if the goal is 1800?** In a 1-hour interview, an 1800 problem is used to see how you _think_ when you are failing. If you can confidently solve 1600s, you will have the logical tools to "partially solve" or "meaningfully discuss" an 1800.
    

### 3. Strategy for the "Stage 3" Wall

Since they explicitly say, **"You do not need to solve the question fully to move forward,"** your goal is **Signaling**, not **Solving**.

1. **Talk about Complexity Early:** Say, "I'm looking for a pattern that avoids $O(n^2)$ because $N$ is $10^5$."
    
2. **The "Aha" Moment:** Most 1800 problems have a "trick" (e.g., "The answer is always even," or "We only need to check the first two elements"). Spend the first 15 minutes hunting for that trick by testing small cases (N=1, N=2, N=3) on a whiteboard.
    
3. **Explain the "Why":** If you can't finish the code, but you can explain the **mathematical proof** of why your approach _should_ work, you are likely to pass.
