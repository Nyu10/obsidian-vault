|# Platform Engineer opportunity - $300k + equity/token - London /New York (on-site)|
<br>\\|Web3 Recruiter at TechChain \\\| AI & Web3 \\\| A recruitment partner that helps Web3 start-up’s scale from 0→1\\\| London-based \\\| Fluent in French & English\\|<br>\\|London, England, United Kingdom\\||
I’m reaching out with a standout opportunity at Baton, the team behind pump.fun, one of the fastest-growing crypto-native platforms globally. They’re hiring a Platform Engineer in London / New york , and the scope is exceptional: high-impact infra work, elite team, and a product that’s already generated $800M in revenue since launch last year.  <br> This role sits at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, security, and blockchain scalability. You’d be working across:  <br>* Infra-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation)  <br>* Container orchestration and security (K8s, Docker)  <br>* Secrets and key management  <br>* Blockchain infra monitoring and scanning  <br>  <br>Ideal candidates are fluent in Go, Rust, or C++, and have hands-on experience with CI/CD, cloud security, and production-grade infra. Web3 experience is a plus, but not required; they’re looking for engineers who ship, solve, and scale.  Compensation is highly competitive ($300K base + token/equity), and interviews are fast-moving with direct access to the founding team. The role is on-site in London (Farringdon)|

</sup>

Things to note -> I'm only looking for new york


Questions to ask
	“How many engineers are there currently, and how is the team split across platform, security, and product?”
	
The $1.3B raise is massive. How much of that is allocated to 'defense and settlements' vs. building the new multi-chain ecosystem (Padre/Kolscan)

	“Can you share how the RICO lawsuit is affecting hiring and the long-term outlook of the business, especially for engineers joining now?”
	
“Stepping back a bit — what is the founders’ vision for moving toward a genuinely fair and ethical financial model as the company evolves?”

Obv what's the interview process like


> “If I hear **defensiveness, minimization, or moral shrugging**, I’m out.”

No second-guessing.  
No “but the comp…”  
No “maybe I can fix it from inside.”

## 12 Lydia Moon Startup: Endex
Talent director candidate labs



Founders of endex
They’re building model-agnostic compound agents that decompose complex financial workflows into multi-step reasoning chains. High concurrency, low latency, massive data scale.

**HIRING ROLES (NYC, 5-6x/week in office):**

• **Backend / Infra Engineer** – build high-scale, low-latency systems for compound agents

**HIGHLIGHTS:**

• **Impressive Seed round**, including a **$10M investment from OpenAI**

• **OpenAI’s flagship bet** in applied AI for finance in 2024

• Infra for compound systems: serialization, heuristics, high-scale data, low latency

• Tiny team (10) with ex-founders and **high-slope engineers**


Tarun Amasa and Pratham Soni worked at openAI 1 year


she works for candidate labs andrezen, sequioia 

go over endex, preferenes for waht i'm looking for 


no hallucinations

10 engineers, 20 total team

do they have revenue, + months of runaways ?
	not able to answer

have they been hiring more specifically with people with a finance background

workign more on their financial heuristics and such 
	thier blog with their relationship with Open AI


Questions?
- **The "OpenAI" Relationship:** "Lydia, you mentioned this is OpenAI’s 'flagship bet' in finance. How integrated is that relationship? Do the engineers actually collaborate with OpenAI research, or is it just a branding/investment play?"
    
- **The "6-Day Week" Reality:** "The 5-6x/week in-office requirement is a strong signal. What kind of person thrives in that environment, and what is the 'turnover' like? Are people burning out, or is the intensity what's keeping the team bonded?"

"They raised $14M at the Seed/Series A stage. For a team of 10, that’s a massive amount of capital. What’s the hiring plan for the next year? Are they trying to stay lean or scale to 50+ quickly?"

## 1-120 Ian Arambul 
Talent Principal @ Amya Agency
Upstart -> fully remote
- **Company Mission**: Traditional credit scores miss millions of good borrowers. Upstart’s AI-driven approach makes credit cheaper, faster, and fairer. Not a bank, not just a marketplace, and not SaaS - they’re a category-of-one platform at the intersection of AI, lending, and infrastructure.

  
- **The Role**: Engineers are needed across three core teams - Pricing, Loan Servicing, and Capital Markets - all tackling 0→1 challenges with massive scope. High visibility, trajectory-focused culture, and peers from **Google, Stripe, Meta, Lyft,** and top startups. Company is hiring 40+ engineers this quarter alone, so massive opportunity to scale.

- **Remote**: Fully remote across the US and Canada (not Quebec)


- **Compensation**: Competitive base pay with RSUs that vest quarterly (no cliff) plus annual refreshes.


 If not, I’m also working with a handful of early-stage startups as well including [Decagon](https://znsrc.com/c/oitikublgj) and [Cognition](https://znsrc.com/c/zkjisfclyd).

## 1:20 Kyle BeBore (15 mins) Startup : Moab

<sup>
I noticed you're working over at Robinhood and think your background could be a strong fit for what we're building at Moab.  
  
[Moab](https://www.trymoab.com/) is on a mission to solve massive technical challenges in multi-trillion-dollar industries like agriculture, construction, and logistics that are run on antiquated software from the 1980s/1990s.  
  
We're building unified infrastructure to modernize these real-world industries, replacing fragmented systems and manual workflows with a platform that actually works.  
  
Founded in 2023, we've raised $18M, found early product-market fit, and are already generating revenue. Team of 13, led by ex-Ramp founding engineers working onsite in the Flatiron area.  
  
We're looking for a recent CS grad who is product-minded and motivated by outsized responsibility. You'll build 0→1, work directly with customers, and do much more than just code. Here's a [quick link](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/moab/3d60277d-29d6-4556-809c-3cdc532244d6) to our job description.   
  
If you'd be open to hearing more about this opportunity, please suggest a great time for you to have a quick chat or feel free to [schedule 15 minutes here](https://calendly.com/kyle-15min-intro-call/moab) at your convenience.

</sup>

Questions to Ask:
- In a team of 13, I assume the structure is flat. Who would I report to, and how does the engineering team handle mentorship vs. pure autonomy for a recent grad?"

You mentioned early product-market fit. Can you share the current ARR range and what the specific 'North Star' metric or revenue goal is for the next 12 months?"


What is the current monthly net burn, and how many months of runway does the $18M provide?

These real-world industries (Ag/Construction) are famously hard to break into. What was the 'wedge' or the specific pain point that allowed Moab to displace legacy software from the 90s?"

Obv whats the interview process like


told him april 10 frame 
	will have update for that by friday or early next week 





Yuzu 
- **Funding & Fundamentals:**
    
    - Raised **$5 million** in a Seed round in late 2023.
        
    - **Investors:** Led by Lachy Groom and Day One Ventures, with participation from Altman Capital.
        
    - **Status:** In a growth phase. Their "fundamentals" are typical for a seed-stage company—high burn rate as they scale, but strong investor backing from top-tier Silicon Valley names.
        
- **Outlook:** Solid. They are tackling a massive, high-margin market (employer healthcare), though they face heavy regulation.

- **"What is your current 'burn rate' and how many months of runway do we have left?"**
    
- **"What are the specific milestones we need to hit to raise our next round of funding?"**


**"Can you explain the current cap table? How much of the company is founder-owned vs. investor-owned?"**
