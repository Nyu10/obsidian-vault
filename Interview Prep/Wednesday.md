Hey Nehemiah! I'm Neil - co-founder @ Conversion. Can I offer you a pair of free airpods for 30 minutes of your time? We just closed a $28M Series A and, like many of the strongest startups in the Bay Area, are looking for the best engineers in the world to join us on the journey. There are three things I believe are unique about engineering at Conversion:  
  

1. Strong ownership: We are building enterprise grade software for customers such as OpenAI, 11x, and Clay but remain only an engineering team of 7. We are looking for folks who love autonomy in their work and want to be a strong lever in the company's success.
2. Intriguing engineering problems: We are building software to manage critical marketing infrastructure at immense scale for large customers. We manage hundreds of millions of email sends and millions of workflow runs per month with the expectation of near perfect reliability.
3. Best-in-class team: We are really proud of the strong, albeit young, engineering culture we have built thus far (ex IMC, Pinterest, C3, Meta, Microsoft, etc.). You can check out engineering blogs written by our engineering leads here: [https://conversion.ai/blog/behind-the-curtain-how-conversion-syncs-millions-of-customer-records-a-day](https://conversion.ai/blog/behind-the-curtain-how-conversion-syncs-millions-of-customer-records-a-day)

  
We are very intentional when we reach out, and only reach out when we feel the fit is likely to be strong. As a testament to that, we are happy to offer a pair of free airpods for your time. Even if you are slightly thinking about a change (and willing to work in-person in SF), I'd love to chat.Let me know if we can book a quick 15 min

### Strala

what does strala DO

they hit 7 figure ARR in less than a year
they have peter theil's founder fund

talent from here Optiver, Meta, and Palantir

AI insurance claims
Claim processors for insurance companies 
1. **Multi-Modal FNOL:** Using AI to handle the "First Notice of Loss" (intake) via voice, text, or images.
    
2. **Conversational AI Workforce:** An AI agent that follows up with vendors, updates claimants, and handles documentation with "human-like" understanding.
    
3. **Fraud & Routing:** They claim their real-time fraud detection is "better than any human" and have already saved carriers over **$7M**.



"Since Strala acts as an AI-native TPA rather than just a software vendor, how do you balance the 'human-in-the-loop' oversight with the goal of full automation?"

what will career progression look like at STRALA is it flat or would i be considered a mid level/ junior? 


Elevator PItch
"I’ve been following Strala’s trajectory, and reaching multi-seven-figure ARR in under a year is incredible—that’s the kind of high-velocity environment I thrive in.


big step for bodily injury -> communciation and process fax 

Self-insured companies
subsidiary acting as an insurance company

captives are a bit different
 7 figure contract
 rents our uber and lyft drivers
extremely unahppy with current solution

8 full tiem engineers -> 3 joined in the alst 3 weeks

live coding 
	-> not leetcode applied example of code base
	
system design
-> design a ssystem around that problem
conceptual quesitons
-> anythinig about programming (parallelism,d atabase, applied AI or ML)

sequence is not the same 




t’s explicitly written in their **"Zero Barriers"** policy within their job listings. They state:
> _"We want the best people and will do whatever it takes. That includes full relocation support, **covering all meals** and paying for any product that makes you more productive."_


You hit multi-seven-figure ARR incredibly fast. What is the biggest technical bottleneck to hitting the _next_ 10x?"

		cofounder CTO
		background research -> Switzerland
		AI research
I love HubSpot, but I'm looking for the **intensity** of a 'zero-to-one' build. I want to be where the AI is actually being deployed into high-stakes production environments, not just experiment labs."

insurance is much larger than expected

whoa re ur main companies 
	outsource insurancen claims, 260 B
	voice AI -> text -> photos -> videos (video models are not there yet

i was wondering how did htey grow so fast what was in the MVP that insurance companies were so willing to work with you

three steps 1 billion
1) prove PMF 15 million next several months
2) acquire companies, but get contracts
3) try to aquire crawford -> profit margin is 2% Improve marign
