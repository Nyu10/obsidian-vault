### Engineering @ Profound - $35M Series B - $20M ARR - Backed by Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, and Khosla Backed

Hi Nehemiah,  
  
Love your background!  
  
I'm working with the founders of [Profound](https://www.tryprofound.com/), [**Dylan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/babbsdj) **(co-founder, CTO)** and [**James**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsca/) **(co-founder, CEO).** Their customer list is insane. From Ramp, Docusign, and Zapier to industry giants like Walmart, Shopify and US Bank. They just locked down their Series B and the cap table is stacked: [Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-profound-winning-on-the-ai-stage/), Kleiner Perkins, and Khosla.  
  
They're building out SEO Optimization platforms for LLM-based AI Web Search (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude). They reverse engineer how these models surface content and help marketing teams use that to their advantage!  
  
**Why Profound is compelling:**
