Coding Books to read
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)** [[01:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Phlq0kmImE&t=74)]
    
    Described as a "philosophy course disguised as a programming manual," this book uses the Scheme language to teach you how to think about computation itself rather than just syntax. It focuses on viewing programs as a composition of ideas.
    
- **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** [[02:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Phlq0kmImE&t=120)]
    
    This book provides a "full stack" look at how hardware and software interact, covering everything from C and assembly to memory hierarchy, the OS, and networks. It helps you understand what is actually happening in the machine when your code runs.
    
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** [[02:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Phlq0kmImE&t=167)]
    
    Considered a blueprint for how modern software works at scale, this book focuses on systems architecture—how databases, queues, and storage systems interact to handle massive amounts of data in applications like Twitter or YouTube.

They siad this book is super good 
Computer Systems A Programmer’s Perspective
https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS295/assets/books/CSAPP_2016.pdf

the other books like three easy pieces (OS)

reccomended road map
- **CS:APP (The Machine):** Understand how one computer works.
    
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications (The Scaled System):** This is often considered the "sequel" to CS:APP. It moves from one machine to many.
    
- **Understanding Distributed Systems (The Architecture):** Read this once you have the foundations, to learn the specific patterns (CAP theorem, consensus) used to glue those machines together.
