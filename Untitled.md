Thish is a sunday celebraiton sermon probs like the one right before UGR? on deeper intimacy


Why am I the way I am
Why do I care about the things I care about 
Why do I worry and am afraid of the things I want 

Psalm 119:33-40 

Prayer for understanding 
Team me the way (v 33)
Give me understanding (v 34)
To the end, with my whole heart 

Give me understanding why do I respond this way ?

Invitation to formation 

Lead me in the path (v35)
Incline my heart (v36)
Turn my eyes (v37)

Away from selfishness and worthless things 
(V36,37)
What um is this passage teaching me?



Resting on our foundation 

Confirm your promise (v38)
Your rules are good (v39)
I long for your precepts (v40)

What promises of God can I rest in

Contentment is highly correlated with the quality of your "inner circle."  

• The Depth Check: Who can you call at 2:00 AM? Who knows what you’re struggling with right now?

• Action: Write down three things you currently have that you once prayed for.



How do you read and reflect on the Bible
