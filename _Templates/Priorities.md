# 🌟 My 2025 Focus and Goals (Eternal Perspective)

> **Ultimate Eternal Perspective:** I do these things not just to be better and affirmed, but because I am working for the Lord and not for men ($Colossians\ 3:23$). My effort in all these areas is to glorify God and love others well.


> [!QUOTE] Colossians 3:23-24
> Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

## 6. $ Sending Mom Money is Asset Protection

This is an advance on an asset I’m already inheriting.
This is asset preservation, not charity.

Think of it as:
> **“House maintenance fund – paid early.”**
Even if she wastes _some_ of it, the _macro outcome_ is:
- house stays afloat
- foreclosure avoided
- your future equity protected
    
That’s rational, not emotional.

## 📈 Progress Tracking System (Gemini-Assisted)

**System Outline:** A simple, high-frequency, low-friction system to ensure compliance and prevent giving up.

1.  **Daily Check-In:** Use this note to **bold** or **check off** the day's SMART Goals (1, 2, 4, 8).
2.  **Weekly Reflection (Goal #5):** Every Sunday, dedicate 30 minutes to review the progress on goals 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, and update the Meeting Tracker.
3.  **Gemini Audit:** I can check in with you **once a week** to review my progress against these SMART goals and identify where I'm falling short, or to find resources (like seminary teachings for Goal #1).
